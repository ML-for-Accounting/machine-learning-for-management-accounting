These statements include the plans and objectives of management for future operations, including plans and objectives relating to future growth of our business and availability of funds. Such forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as  may,   will,   expect,   intend,   might,   plan,   believe,   anticipate,   estimate,   could,   would   continue,   pursue,  or  should  or the negative thereof or other variations or similar words or phrases.

Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control.

         Table of Contents               Item 1 - Business          As used in this annual report, the terms  we ,  us ,  our ,  Gen Next , and the  Company  means Generation NEXT Franchise Brands, Inc., a Nevada corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiaries Fresh Healthy Vending LLC, a California limited liability company, Fresh and Healthy Vending Corporation, a California corporation, Reis   Irvy s, Inc., a Nevada corporation, 19 Degrees, Inc., a Nevada corporation, Generation Next Vending Robots, Inc., a Nevada corporation, or their management  .  Also as used in this annual report, the term  Gen Next  refers to Generation NEXT Franchise Brands, Inc.,  FHV LLC  refers to Fresh Healthy Vending LLC,  R I  refers to Reis   Irvy s, Inc.,  19 Degrees  refers to 19 Degrees, Inc.,  Fresh and Healthy  refers to Fresh and Healthy Vending Corporation, and  GNVR  refers to Generation Next Vending Robots.          Business         Generation Next Franchise Brands Inc. primarily develops and operates franchise concepts as well as related technology. Generally, the franchise business model allows other individuals or companies (franchisees) to own and operate businesses using the trademarks, intellectual property, expertise, ideas, and processes that are owned and developed by another company (the franchisor). Franchise concepts owned or developed by the Company are held and operated by various subsidiaries, who become the franchisor, such as Reis   Irvy s Inc., a franchise concept involving robotic soft serve vending robots. As such, the Company s segments are Reis   Irvy s, Fresh Healthy Vending, LLC, and all other operations.       Not all of the Company s business opportunities will strictly involve a franchise business model. In some instances the Company may seek to license the rights to its robotic vending technology or seek revenue from a combination of the license and sale of its robotic vending technology. To date, the Company has not recognized any license revenue or entered into any such agreement. In other instances the Company may license the rights to another company to become the franchisor of the Company s franchise concepts.        Previous to our current focus of vending frozen yogurt robots, we were a franchisor of vending machines and operator of Company-owned vending machines and micro markets that made healthy eating more convenient through access to high quality healthy foods at high foot traffic vending destinations. As of March 2016, we began to wind down the marketing our healthy vending franchises, although we continue to support our ongoing franchisees. As of September 28, 2018, FHV LLC has executed an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors under California law, whereby all of the assets of FHV LLC have been assigned to a third party fiduciary who will expeditiously liquidate such assets and distribute the proceeds thereof to FHV LLC s creditors pursuant to the priorities established and permitted by law.        We anticipate cultivating and growing other franchise concepts that complement our existing franchise portfolio.                    4        
         Table of Contents               History         On July 19, 2013 (the   Closing Date  ) our wholly-owned subsidiary, FHV Acquisition Corp., completed a Reorganization and Asset Acquisition Agreement (the   Acquisition Agreement  ) with FHV Holdings Corp, a California corporation (   FHV Cal   ) (the    FHV Acquisition   ). Pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, we issued 15,648,298 shares of our Company s common stock (as adjusted for the Stock Split) to FHV Cal, in exchange for all FHV Cal s assets as of the Closing Date. FHV Cal s principal asset consisted of the operations and assets of Fresh Healthy Vending LLC, a California limited liability company. At the closing, FHV Cal distributed the Company s common stock to the sole shareholder of FHV Cal, a trust affiliated with Nicholas Yates, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.       On July 19, 2013, we also completed the sale of 2,235,951 shares of our common stock to 18 investors (  Stock Sale  ) in exchange for gross proceeds totaling $1,000,000 (approximately $996,000 net of estimated related costs in connection with the transaction). In addition, on July 19, 2013, we converted $210,000 of convertible notes payable into 552,418 shares of common stock. For accounting purposes, the transaction was determined to be and accounted for as a reverse merger.       In connection with the Acquisition Agreement, we entered into a Business Transfer and Indemnity Agreement dated July 22, 2013 (the   Indemnity Agreement  ) with our former Chief Executive Officer Daniel Duval providing for:                    1.      The sale to Mr. Duval of our business existing on the date of the Indemnity Agreement (the   GEEM Business                                           2.      The assumption by Mr. Duval of all liabilities of our Company and the indemnification by Mr. Duval holding our Company harmless for any and all liabilities arising at or before the date of the Indemnity Agreement;                            3.      The payment to Mr. Duval of $191,000 in cash; and                            4.      The surrender by Mr. Duval of 11,671,713 shares of our Company s common stock (all of which shares were cancelled by our Company).          We are a public company traded on the OTC Markets under the symbol  VEND.  We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 8, 2011 as Green 4 Media, Inc. Prior to July 19, 2013, we were an eco-marketing and advertising company (  GEEM Business  ). On July 22, 2013, we entered into the Indemnity Agreement and in connection with that agreement we transferred the GEEM Business to our former Chief Executive Officer. Effective August 8, 2013, we changed the name of our Company from Green 4 Media, Inc. to Fresh Healthy Vending International, Inc., and in March 2016, we changed the name of our Company to Generation NEXT Franchise Brands, Inc.       FHV LLC was formed as a limited liability company in California in 2010, as a franchisor of healthy drinks and snack vending machines. Including the operating history of YoNaturals, whose assets were contributed to FHV LLC in August 2010, we have a combined nine year operating history in vending machines providing food and beverages. Because it was determined the assets of FHV LLC are currently insufficient to satisfy FHV LLC s obligations to creditors, as of September 28, 2018, FHV LLC has executed an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors under California law, whereby all of the assets of FHV LLC have been assigned to a third party fiduciary who will expeditiously liquidate such assets and distribute the proceeds thereof to FHV LLC s creditors pursuant to the priorities established and permitted by law.                    5        
         Table of Contents              Reis   Irvy s Robotic Soft Serve Vending Robot         On December 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ) with Robofusion, Inc. ( RFI ), whereby the Company acquired the intellectual property assets of RFI, a developer of robotic-kiosk vending technology, primarily frozen yogurt and ice cream vending robots, using RFI's trademarked name of Reis   Irvy's (the  Acquisition ). The Company considered the guidance in ASC 805,  Business Combinations,  and determined the transaction was a purchase of an asset. As a result, the estimated fair of the assets acquired were capitalized. The intent of the purchase was to combine robotics and artificial intelligence platforms to facilitate the manufacture of an unattended robot in order to disrupt traditional frozen yogurt and ice cream retail establishments and, on a larger scale, establish ourselves as an industry leader in the emerging and fast-growing space of unattended retail. Since acquisition, we have developed a state-of-the art robotic soft serve vending robot that is a completely unique vending machine and entertainment experience. The robot accepts cash, credit cards, and is the first of its kind to accept bitcoin. A proprietary software platform is utilized that allows us to readily monitor the sales of our franchisees  and our corporate-owned machines, which assists our franchisees and us in facilitating the management and maintenance of the vending robot. In order to protect the Company s rights, several U.S. and international patents have been approved and granted. Our vending standards are UL (  Underwriters Laboratories  ) (approval in process), NSF (  National Sanitation Foundation  ) recognized (approved in August 2018), and National Automated Merchandising Association (  NAMA )  certified (approved in September 2018), which we believe are among the highest standards in the industry. NAMA estimates that 100 million Americans will use one of seven million vending machines each day. This ensures food temperature compliance, which includes auto-contingency processes should electrical or hardware malfunction; it also ensures that ambient air stays within specified parameters at all times. Our third-party cashless payment technology provides the highest level of data and network security compliance while ensuring complete transparency. As a result, our robotic soft serve vending robots will contain minimal amounts of cash. All transactions are managed by third parties to facilitate financial compliance with local and national laws and regulations. Funds from all electronic transactions are collected by Reis   Irvy s and remitted to the franchisee within ten days of the subsequent month.        Reis   Irvy s sells franchise rights, generally a 1- year term, for the use of its trademarks and technology, robotic soft serve vending robots, and secures locations for franchisee robots. Potential franchisees are interviewed by sales people and complete a questionnaire. Those who meet certain financial criteria and deemed a good fit are provided franchising information based on their respective states franchise regulations, generally a Franchise Disclosure Document. After the cooling off period, approximately 14 calendar days, Reis   Irvy s and the franchisee enter into a franchise agreement, which state the term, sales price, location of the franchise, and each party s rights and obligations. Reis   Irvy s offers franchises in every state in the Unites States with the exception of South Dakota. Master franchises are offered for certain large geographic locations. To date, the Company has entered into master franchise agreements in Australia, Canada, Israel, and Oman. However, no revenue has been recognized.       As of the date of this report, the Company sold 1,417 units representing approximately $59 million in vending robots and franchise fees. For the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company had recognized approximately $137,000 from the sale of vending robots and approximately $14,000 in franchise fees, respectively. No revenues from licenses were earned or recognized, and royalty revenue was considered immaterial. Further, the Company has contractual commitments for approximately 3,200 units representing approximately $128 million in potential revenue. As of the date of this report, the Company installed and delivered 75 vending robots to franchisees in various locations throughout the United States.       In order to assist franchisees with support and pay for certain administrative costs (e.g. merchant fees, software fees, etc.) Reis   Irvy s charges a monthly royalty fee of 12% of gross receipts. As of June 30, 2018, royalty revenue was not material.       Franchisees are responsible for obtaining all Federal, state and local health department licenses and certifications. Further, franchisees are responsible for all routine repairs and maintenance. However, a 1 year warranty for all parts is provided, and extended warranties are available for purchase from Reis   Irvy s.                     6        
         Table of Contents              Frozen Yogurt and Ice Cream Products         The Company has set up distribution partners to carry the consumable products required for the frozen yogurt and ice cream robots. Franchisees order consumable products directly from the distribution partners and are responsible for those costs. If consumable products became unavailable from the Company s distribution partners, the Company believes a replacement would be readily available due to the homogeneous nature of the product.          Competition         The vending industry is large, highly fragmented and consolidating. We believe we have laid the foundation for a robust network of vending robots for our franchisees by implementing a strong business model that offers the following competitive advantages:                            Partnering with Compass Groups USA, a large operator of food service locations throughout the world, to provide accounts for our vending Robots.                                             Engaging Flex Ltd. to manufacture the vending robots.                                           Procuring components of the vending robot from trusted vendors with a history of high-quality products.                                          Sourcing the highest quality products from recognized industry leaders, such as Dannon.                                          Issuance of U.S. and international patents.               Our Principal Suppliers        The Company currently sources the components for all of its vending robots from various vendors, and has contracted with Flex Ltd., for the assembly and manufacture of the robotic soft serve vending kiosks. Additionally, there are a number of suppliers who provide various subcomponents of the robotic kiosks. We believe that our relationship with our suppliers is excellent, and likely to continue. In our view, the loss of our relationship with Flex Ltd., should it occur, may result in short term disruptions not likely to be material. The Company has identified other suppliers with comparable capabilities, the Company estimates that these suppliers could replace the current suppliers within three months if needed.       The Company has also entered into an agreement with Dannon YoCream, for Dannon YoCream to be a primary supplier of all frozen desserts available within the Reis   Irvy s Froyo Robots, including a wide assortment of frozen yogurts, sorbets and gelatos as well as kosher products.         Governmental Regulation        We are required to comply with regulations governing the sale of franchises   the primary component of our business. Fifteen states directly regulate franchising and fourteen require pre-sale registration of a Franchise Disclosure Document (  FDD  ), or offering prospectus, by the franchisor, normally with the state agency that oversees the sale of securities in that state, and pre-sale delivery of an FDD to a franchise candidate by a franchisor before the signing of a binding agreement or the payment of any money to the franchisor. Franchise sales in the remaining 35 states are generally subject to the Franchise Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (  FTC  ), which requires the pre-sale delivery of an FDD to a franchise candidate before the signing of a binding agreement or the payment of any money to the franchisor. A franchisor that fails to properly register and maintain the registration of its FDD and disclose its franchisee candidates in the 15 registration states, unless exempt from registration under a few narrowly drawn exceptions to the registration requirements, is subject to legal action by its franchisees for damages and, under certain circumstances, for rescission of the franchise agreements, and to administrative, civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed as well. The FTC s Franchise Rule does not require registration of an FDD with the FTC. Reis   Irvy s offers franchises in each state within the United States, with the exception of South Dakota.        Reis   Irvy s and franchisees are required to comply with all Federal, state and location regulations related to food handling.         Available Information        We file various reports with the SEC, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, which are available through the SEC s electronic data gathering, analysis and retrieval system ( EDGAR ) by accessing the SEC s home page (http://www.sec.gov).

         Table of Contents              Our Employees        We had approximately 36 full-time employees as of June 30, 2018. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.        Seasonality        We do not expect that our business will experience significant seasonality due to the number and location of the frozen yogurt and ice cream robots.          Item 1A   Risk Factors          An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Current Report, before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should read the section entitled  Special Notes Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  for a discussion of what types of statements are forward-looking statements as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this report.         RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS          Reis   Irvy s          Risks Related to Competition, Evolving Technologies and Consumer Preferences in Our Industry          The termination, non-renewal or renegotiation on materially adverse terms of our contracts or relationships with a significant collection of franchisees, or retail locations could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.   The success of our business depends in large part on our, and our franchisees  ability to maintain contractual relationships with the providers of profitable locations in which vending robots are placed, including hospitals, entertainment venues, retail stores, shopping centers and the like. Certain contract provisions with these providers vary, including product and service offerings, the service fees we, and our franchisees , are committed to pay, and the ability to cancel the contract upon notice. We typically enter into vending robot installation agreements that give the retailer rights of termination. We strive to provide direct and indirect benefits to our location partners that are superior to, or competitive with, other providers or systems or alternative uses of the floor space that our Robots occupy. If we are unable to provide them with adequate benefits, we may be unable to maintain or renew our contractual relationships on acceptable terms, causing our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer. The locations in which vending robots are placed may choose to replace our or our franchisees  vending robots with competitor machines or not provide space for such machines at all deciding that floor space could be used for other purposes.                    8        
         Table of Contents               Competitive pressures could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.   Our Reis   Irvy s business faces competition from other providers of frozen confections and other desert options, including some that may have more experience, better financing, and better relationships with preferred high traffic locations. We also face general competition from supermarkets, frozen yogurt stores, ice cream parlors/shops and other retail locations that provide ice cream, frozen yogurt and other frozen treats. We could also face competition from other newly created forms of similar or replacement kiosks/vending machines offering frozen treats. In addition, other ice cream/frozen yogurt retailers, some of which have significantly more resources than we do, may decide to enter the market, or expand their current market share.         If we cannot execute on our strategy and offer new automated retail products and services, our business could suffer.   Our strategy is based upon leveraging our core competencies in the automated retail space to provide the consumer with convenience and value and to help retailers drive incremental traffic and revenue. To be competitive, we need to offer new product and service offerings that are accepted by the market and establish third-party relationships necessary to develop and commercialize such product and service offerings. We are exploring new businesses to enter, and new products and services to offer; however, the complexities and structures of these new businesses and products could create conflicting priorities, constrain limited resources, and negatively impact our core businesses. We may use our financial resources and management s time and focus to invest in other companies offering automated retail services, such as our acquisition of the Reis   Irvy s intellectual property, or we may seek to offer new products or services on our current Robots. We may enter into joint ventures through which we may expand our product offerings. Any new business opportunity also may have its own unique risks related to operations, finances, intellectual property, technology, legal and regulatory issues, corporate governance or other challenges, for which we may have limited or no prior experience. In addition, if we fail to timely establish or maintain relationships with significant retailers and suppliers, we may not be able to provide our consumers with desirable new products and services. Further, to develop and commercialize certain new products and services, we will need to create new Robots or enhance the capabilities of our current robots, as well as adapt our related networks and systems through appropriate technological solutions for an automated retail environment, and establish market acceptance of such products or services. We cannot assure you that new products or services that we provide will be successful or profitable.         We depend upon third-party manufacturers, suppliers and service providers for key components and substantial support for our Robots.   We conduct no manufacturing operations and depend on outside parties to manufacture and supply key components of our Robots. Any increase in the manufacturing costs, or our inability to lower our current manufacturing costs, could materially adversely impact our operations and financial condition.       We intend to continue to expand our installed base of Robots. Such expansion may be limited by the manufacturing capacity of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers. Third-party manufacturers may not be able to meet our manufacturing needs in a satisfactory and timely manner. Any delays in manufacturing could adversely affect our results of operations. If there is an unanticipated increase in demand for our Robots, or our manufacturing needs are not met in a timely and satisfactory manner, we may be unable to meet demand due to manufacturing limitations.       We currently rely on a single manufacturer of the Robots. We may be unable to continue to obtain an adequate supply of these components from our suppliers in a timely manner or, if necessary, from alternative sources. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of components from our current suppliers or locate alternative sources of supply on a timely basis, we may experience delays in installing or maintaining our Robots, either of which could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.       In addition, we rely on third-party service providers for substantial support and service efforts that we currently do not provide directly. In particular, we contract with third-party providers to arrange for servicing of our Robots. We generally contract with a provider to service a particular region. We do not currently have, nor do we expect to have in the foreseeable future, the internal capability to provide back-up service in the event of a sudden disruption in service. Any failure by us to maintain our existing relationships or to establish new relationships on a timely basis or on acceptable terms could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.                    9        
         Table of Contents               Defects, failures or security breaches in and inadequate upgrades of, or changes to, our operating systems could harm our business.   The operation of our Robots depends on sophisticated software, hardware, and computer networking and communication services that may contain undetected errors or may be subject to failures or complications. These errors, failures or complications may arise particularly when new, changed or enhanced products or services are added. In the past, there have been limited delays and disruptions resulting from upgrading or improving these operating systems. Future upgrades, improvements or changes that may be necessary to expand and maintain our business could result in delays or disruptions or may not be timely or appropriately made, any of which could seriously harm our operations.       Further, certain aspects of the operating systems relating to our business are provided by third parties, including telecommunications. Accordingly, the effectiveness of these operating systems is, to a certain degree, dependent on the actions and decisions of third parties over whom we may have limited control.         We may  be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.     Our success in business is impacted by maintaining the confidentiality and proprietary nature of our intellectual property rights. Our ability to compete may be damaged, and our revenues may  be reduced if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately. To protect these rights, we rely principally on a combination of:                         contractual arrangements providing for non-disclosure and prohibitions on use;                   patents and pending patent applications;                   trade secret, copyright and trademark laws; and                   certain built-in technical product features.          Patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws provide limited protection. The protections provided by laws governing intellectual property rights do not prevent competitors from developing, independently, products similar or superior to our products and technologies. In addition, effective protection of copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, and other proprietary rights may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. We may be unaware of certain non-publicly available patent applications, which, if issued as patents, could relate to our services and products as currently designed or as we may modify them in the future. Legal or regulatory proceedings to enforce our patents, trademarks or copyrights could be costly, time consuming, and could divert the attention of management and technical personnel.          Generation Next Franchising Brands           Failure to adequately comply with information security policies or to safeguard against breaches of such policies could adversely affect our operations and could damage our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations.   In the process of making sales using consumer credit cards or other cashless options as a method of payment, we may handle and transfer such information as part of our business. These activities are subject to laws and regulations, as well as industry standards, in the United States and other jurisdictions in which our products and services are available. These requirements, which often differ materially and sometimes conflict among the many jurisdictions in which we operate, are designed to protect the privacy of consumers  personal information and to prevent that information from being inappropriately used or disclosed. We maintain and review technical and operational safeguards designed to protect this information and generally require others with whom we work to do so as well. However, despite those safeguards, it is possible that hackers, employees acting contrary to our policies, third-party agents or others could improperly access relevant systems or improperly obtain or disclose data about our consumers, or that we may be determined not to be in compliance with applicable legal and/or regulatory requirements and industry standards for data security, such as the Payment Card Industry guidelines. A breach or purported breach of relevant security policies that compromises consumer data or determination of non-compliance with applicable legal and/or regulatory requirements and industry standards for data security could expose us to regulatory enforcement actions, card association or other monetary fines or sanctions, or contractual liabilities, limit our ability to provide our products and services, subject us to legal action and related costs and damage our business reputation, financial position, and results of operations.                      Litigation, arbitration, mediation, regulatory actions, investigations or other legal proceedings could result in material rulings, decisions, settlements, fines, penalties or publicity that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.   Our business has in the past been, and may in the future continue to be, party to regulatory actions, investigations, arbitration, mediation and other legal proceedings. The outcome of such proceedings is often difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs, regulatory bodies or other parties may seek very large or indeterminate amounts of money from us or substantial restrictions on our business activities, or delay or inhibit the sale of new franchises and additional vending machines and micro markets and the results, including the magnitude, of lawsuits, actions, settlements, decisions, and regulatory investigations and delays may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend, settle or otherwise finalize lawsuits, regulatory actions, investigations, arbitrations, mediations or other legal proceedings may be significant and such proceedings may divert our management s time. In addition, there may be adverse publicity associated with any such developments that could decrease consumer acceptance of our products and services, such as foodborne illness claims related to perishable foods. As a result, litigation, arbitration, mediation, regulatory actions or investigations involving us or our affiliates may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For further description of certain material legal proceedings, please see Item 3  Legal Proceedings  below.         We rely in part on our franchisees, and if our franchisees cannot develop or finance their businesses, our growth and success may be affected.   We rely on our franchisees and the manner in which they operate their locations to develop and promote our business. Although we have developed criteria to evaluate and screen prospective franchisees, we cannot be certain that our franchisees will have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to operate successful franchises in their franchise areas and state franchise laws may limit our ability to terminate or modify these franchise arrangements. Moreover, despite our training, support and monitoring, franchisees may not successfully operate vending machine routes in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or may not hire and train qualified servicing personnel. The failure of our franchisees to operate their franchises successfully could have a material adverse effect on us, our reputation, our brand and our ability to attract prospective franchisees and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.       Franchisees may not have access to the financial or management resources that they need to launch and maintain routes and vending machines contemplated by their agreements with us or be able to find suitable sites on which to develop them, or they may elect to cease development for other reasons. Franchisees may not be able to negotiate or retain acceptable lease terms, including location royalties, for the sites, obtain the necessary permits and government approvals or meet opening schedules. Any of these problems could slow our growth and reduce our franchise revenues.       Additionally, a franchisee bankruptcy could have a substantial negative impact on our ability to collect payments due under such franchisee s franchise arrangements. In a franchisee bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee may reject its franchise arrangements pursuant to Section 365 under the United States Bankruptcy Code, in which case there would be no further royalty payments from such franchisee, and there can be no assurance as to the proceeds, if any, that may ultimately be recovered in a bankruptcy proceeding of such franchisee in connection with a damage claim resulting from such rejection.         Changes in economic conditions could materially affect our ability to maintain or increase sales at our existing franchisees or secure new franchisees.   Both the vending and the frozen yogurt industries depend on consumer discretionary spending. The United States in general or the specific markets in which we operate may suffer from depressed economic activity, recessionary economic cycles, higher fuel or energy costs, low consumer confidence, high levels of unemployment, reduced home values, increases in home foreclosures, investment losses, personal bankruptcies, reduced access to credit or other economic factors that may affect consumers discretionary spending. Economic conditions may remain volatile and may continue to depress consumer confidence and discretionary spending for the near term. Negative economic conditions might cause consumers to make changes to their discretionary spending behavior, including spending currently made in our or our franchisees  vending machines. If such sales decrease, our profitability could decline as we spread fixed costs across a lower level of sales and this could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.         A failure to maintain food safety throughout our supply chain and food-borne illness concerns may result in reputational harm and claims of illness or injury that could adversely affect us  . Food safety is a top priority for our business. Claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry generally, and a number of these claims may exist at any given time. Because food safety issues could be experienced at the source or by food suppliers or distributors, food safety could, in part, be out of our control. Regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illness or other food safety issues such as food tampering or contamination at one of our vending locations could adversely impact our reputation, hindering our ability to renew contracts on favorable terms or to obtain new business, and have a negative impact on our sales. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or contamination at a location served by one of our competitors could result in negative publicity regarding the food service industry generally and could negatively impact our sales. Future food safety issues may also from time to time disrupt our business. In addition, product recalls or health concerns associated with food contamination may also increase our raw materials costs.                          Changes in food and supply costs could adversely affect our results of operations.   Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs. Shortages or interruptions in the availability of certain supplies caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, food contamination, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of our ingredients, which could harm our operations. Any increase in the prices of the food products most critical to our vending machine and micro market offerings could adversely affect our operating results. Although we try to manage the impact that these fluctuations have on our operating results, we remain susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, seasonal fluctuations, weather conditions, demand, food safety concerns, generalized infectious diseases, product recalls and government regulations.       If any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately, or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected. Although we enter into contracts for the purchase of food products and supplies, we do not have long-term contracts for the purchase of all of such food products and supplies. As a result, we may not be able to anticipate or react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices or vending machine pricing, which could cause our operating results to deteriorate. If we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time, that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items in our machines. If that were to happen, affected machines could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter, if customers change their purchasing habits as a result. Our focus on a limited menu would make the consequences of a shortage of a key ingredient more severe. In addition, because we provide moderately priced food, we, or our franchisees, may choose not to, or may be unable to, pass along commodity price increases to consumers. These potential changes in food and supply costs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.         Failure to receive frequent deliveries of the foods and beverages we offer could harm our operations.   Our ability to maintain ours and our franchisees  machines depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, food contamination, which is especially significant with regard to perishable product offerings, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of our ingredients, which could harm our operations. If any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately, or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. If we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time that could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items that are expected to be stocked within our, our or our franchisees  machines. If that were to happen, affected routes could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter, if customers change their purchasing habits as a result. Our focus on a limited menu of fresh and healthy offerings within machines would make the consequences of a shortage of one or key popular items more severe. Furthermore, certain frozen yogurt consumables may only be available from one manufacturer. This reduction in sales could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.                 REGULATORY RISKS          Franchising is a highly regulated industry.   Compliance with regulatory procedures or regulatory delays, actions or inaction could delay franchise and machine sales and seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Fifteen states directly regulate franchising and fourteen require pre-sale registration of a Franchise Disclosure Document ( FDD ), or offering prospectus, by the franchisor, normally with the state agency that oversees the sale of securities in that state, and pre-sale delivery of an FDD to a franchise candidate by a franchisor before the signing of a binding agreement or the payment of any money to the franchisor. Franchise sales in the remaining 35 states are generally subject to the Franchise Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which requires the pre-sale delivery of an FDD to a franchise candidate before the signing of a binding agreement or the payment of any money to the franchisor. A franchisor that fails to properly register and maintain the registration of its FDD and disclose its franchisee candidates in the 15 registration states, unless exempt from registration under a few narrowly drawn exceptions to the registration requirements, is subject to legal action by its franchisees for damages and, under certain circumstances, for rescission of the franchise agreements, and to administrative, civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed as well. The FTC s Franchise Rule does not require registration of an FDD with the FTC.         Franchising is a highly competitive industry.   Competition from other franchisors could impact franchise and machine sales and seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We strive to provide direct and indirect benefits to our franchisees that are superior to, or competitive with, other franchisors. In addition, we rely on our franchisees and the manner in which they operate their locations to develop future franchise and machine sales. If we are unable to provide our franchisees with adequate benefits, or if any significant number of our franchisees are not successful, we may be unable to sell franchises and machines to new franchisees or maintain or renew our contractual relationships with existing franchisees, causing our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer.         As a franchisor, we are subject to federal and state regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we desire to sell franchises and have existing franchisees.   We are required to register a Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD), or offering prospectus, in 14 states, normally with the state agency that oversees the sale of securities in that state, and provide detailed and complete pre-sale disclosures in our FDD to our franchisee candidates with whom we propose to enter into franchise agreements before we can sell our franchises and vending machines.         We have limited control over our franchisees and our franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.   Franchisees are independent and are not our employees. We do not exercise control over their day-to-day operations. We provide training and support to franchisees, but the success and efficiency of operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Consequently, franchisees may not successfully operate routes in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements, with practices spelled out by regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate or may not hire and train qualified personnel. If franchisees do not meet our standards and requirements, our image and reputation, and the image and reputation of other franchisees, may suffer materially and system-wide sales could decline significantly.       Franchisees, as independent business operators, may from time to time disagree with us and our strategies regarding the business or our interpretation of our and their rights and obligations under franchise and development agreements. This may lead to disputes with our franchisees in the future. These disputes may divert the attention of our management and our franchisees from operating routes and affect our image and reputation and our ability to attract franchisees in the future, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.                  New information or attitudes regarding diet and health could result in changes in regulations and consumer consumption habits that could adversely affect our results of operations.   Regulations and consumer eating habits may change as a result of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health. Such changes may include federal, state and local regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of the food and beverages we offer, or impact the manner or types of perishable products we can offer  .  The success of our, and our franchisees , vending operations is dependent, in part, upon our ability to effectively respond to changes in any consumer health regulations and our ability to adapt our food and beverage offerings to trends in food consumption. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly, we may choose or be required to modify or delete certain offered items, which may adversely affect the attractiveness of our food and beverage offerings to customers on those routes. To the extent we are unwilling or unable to respond with appropriate changes to our food and beverage offerings, it could materially affect consumer demand and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.       Government regulation and consumer eating habits may impact our business as a result of changes in attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the adverse health effects of consuming certain foods and the ingredients within them. These changes have resulted in, and may continue to result in, laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food offerings, and they have resulted, and may continue to result in, laws and regulations affecting permissible ingredients and menu offerings. An unfavorable report on, or reaction to, the freshness, taste, quality and perceived health promoting ingredients of our food and beverage offerings, or their nutritional content could negatively influence the demand for our offerings.         We have been under the scrutiny of state regulators overseeing franchising and could be subject to sanctions, costly litigation and requirements to refund amounts received for franchises sold in the past.   In June 2014, we received an inquiry from the California Department of Business Oversight ( DBO ) related to the sale of 15 franchises that occurred between March 2014 and May 2014. On November 7, 2014, the DBO issued a Stop Order and Citation ( Stop Order ), which prohibited us from selling franchises in the state of California until November 7, 2016. The DBO found that we engaged in offers and sales of franchises in California without registration with respect to the three franchise sales we made in August and September 2012, that the sale of 15 franchises that occurred outside the state of California between March 2014 and May 2014 were made pursuant to a franchise disclosure document that contained omissions of material facts by failing to disclose the DBO s prior stop order and the statement of charges and notice of intent to enter an order to cease and desist issued by the state of Washington, and that our prior management failed to exercise due diligence with regard to our registration and disclosure obligations and exposed prospective franchisees to unreasonable risk. The DBO also denied our registration application filed in California on October 3, 2013, imposed administrative penalties against us of $37,500, required us to pay attorneys  fees of $18,200 and required us to again offer rescission and restitution to the 15 franchisees who purchased franchises between March 2014 and May 2014. Nine of the 15 franchisees accepted our offer of rescission and six either denied rescission or failed to respond. The total rescission payments, aggregating $934,500, were completed by July 2015. The independent monitor has issued his final compliance report, and the Stop Order has ended.       As required by the Stop Order, we developed and implemented a compliance program and engaged an independent monitor for the duration of the Stop Order to review and report to the DBO our compliance activities, including compliance with the Stop Order.       If we are required to refund amounts in excess of those that we have forecast, suffer substantial non-forecasted fines or other franchise offering restrictions from state regulators, are subject to expensive litigation or agree to enter into costly settlement agreements in order to discharge liabilities as a result of past business practices, we may be unable to marshal the resources to satisfy such obligations. This would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and an investor could suffer the loss of a substantial portion or all of his investment.       Periodically, we are contacted by other state franchise regulatory authorities and in some cases have been required to respond to inquiries, or make changes to our franchise disclosure documents or franchise offer and sale practices. Management believes these communications from state regulators and corresponding changes in our franchise disclosure documents and practices are administrative in nature and do not indicate the presence of a loss or probable potential loss.                  FINANCIAL RISKS          If we cannot achieve profitable operations, we will need to raise additional capital to continue our operations, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and which may dilute your investment.   We incurred a net loss for the years ended June 30, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Returning to profitability will require us to increase our revenues and manage our product, operating and administrative expenses. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in reestablishing profitability. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to pay our expenses and our existing sources of cash and cash flows are otherwise insufficient to fund our activities, we will need to raise additional funds to continue our operations. Additional funds, if needed, may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Furthermore, if we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we are unsuccessful in achieving profitability and we cannot obtain additional funds on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we may be required to curtail significantly or cease our operations, which could result in the loss of all of your investment in our stock.         Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.   We suffered a net loss for the years ended June 30, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and we had limited working capital on hand. Should we continue to experience net losses and should we lack sufficient working capital, this could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty. If we cannot generate the required revenues and gross margin to achieve profitability or obtain additional capital on acceptable terms, we will need to substantially revise our business plan and an investor could suffer the loss of a significant portion or all of his investment in our Company.         Should we be successful in growing our revenues according to our operating plans, we may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.   The ability to manage and operate our business as we execute our growth strategy will require effective planning. Significant rapid growth could strain our internal resources, leading to a lower quality of customer service, reporting problems and delays in meeting important deadlines resulting in loss of market share and other problems that could adversely affect our financial performance. Our efforts to grow could place a significant strain on our personnel, management systems, infrastructure, liquidity and other resources. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our operations could be adversely affected, resulting in slower growth, critical shortages of cash and a failure to achieve or sustain profitability.         We do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and we may never pay dividends and, consequently, the only opportunity for investors to achieve a return on their investment is if a trading market develops and investors are able to sell their shares for a profit, or if our business is sold at a price that enables investors to recognize a profit.   We currently intend to retain any future earnings to support the development and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including but not limited to our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time. Currently, we are not aware of any agreement or contract that limits or restricts the payment of dividends. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited by state law. Accordingly, we cannot assure investors any return on their investment, other than in connection with a sale of their shares or a sale of our business. At the present time there is a limited trading market for our shares. Therefore, holders of our securities may be unable to sell them. We cannot assure investors that an active trading market will develop or that any third party will offer to purchase our business on acceptable terms and at a price that would enable our investors to recognize a profit.         Our net operating loss ( NOL ) carry-forward is limited.   We have recorded a valuation allowance amounting to our entire net deferred tax asset balance due to our lack of a history of earnings, possible statutory limitations on the use of tax loss carry-forwards generated in the past and the future expiration of our NOL. This gives rise to uncertainty as to whether the net deferred tax asset is realizable. Internal Revenue Code Section 382, and similar California rules, place a limitation on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by carry-forwards after a change in control (generally greater than a 50% change in ownership). As a result of these provisions, it is likely that given our acquisition of FHV Cal, and current losses, future utilization of the NOL will be severely limited. Our inability to use our Company s historical NOL, or the full amount of the NOL, would limit our ability to offset any future tax liabilities with its NOL.                 CORPORATE AND OTHER RISKS          Our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders beneficially own or control over 25% of our outstanding common stock, which may limit your ability and the ability of our other stockholders, whether acting alone or together, to propose or direct the management or overall direction of our Company.   Additionally, this concentration of ownership could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our Company that might otherwise result in an investor receiving a premium over the market price for his shares. A substantial portion of our outstanding shares of common stock is beneficially owned and controlled by a group of insiders, including our directors and executive officers. Accordingly, our principal stockholder together with our directors, executive officers and insider shareholders would have the power to control the election of our directors and the approval of actions for which the approval of our stockholders is required. If you acquire shares of our common stock, you may have no effective voice in the management of our Company. Such concentrated control of our Company may adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our principal stockholders may be able to control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors, mergers or other business combinations. Such concentrated control may also make it difficult for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock in the event we merge with a third party or enter into different transactions which require stockholder approval. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.         Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have limited experience as an Officer of a public company.   To serve in the role of a Chief Executive Officer for a public company, an individual needs to be aware of responsibilities in addition to those shouldered by the leader of a private company. Among such additional responsibilities, the Chief Executive Officer must be able to communicate fairly and effectively with the stakeholders of a public company, be aware of the controls required to be maintained by a public company and act in accordance with the legal requirements incumbent upon such a leader. Our Chief Executive Officer s lack of such experience could increase the danger that we fail to carry out these additional responsibilities effectively and thus materially prejudice our Company and shareholders  financial interests.         We appointed two independent board members of our Board of Directors effective August and September 2018 and we     have an Audit and Compensation Committee.   We have two management members and two independent members of our Board of Directors. Independent directors can act as a check on management and can advise and guide management on corporate actions and in good corporate governance practices. With our lack of multiple independent Board members, our management could make subjective decisions without the benefit of more measured independent guidance. An independent Audit Committee can assure procedural and administrative adherence to internal controls over transactions, financial reporting and the audit process. Among its functions, independent Audit Committees review the financial reporting, internal controls safeguarding Company assets, interact with auditors, may oversee material financial decisions and provide a sounding board for individuals who may question a company s accounting policies and procedures. With our lack of an Audit Committee at this time, we run a greater risk that a significant error or irregularity could occur that could be materially damaging to our shareholders.         Issuances of our authorized preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to effect a change-of-control.   Our articles of incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to issue up to 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the Board of Directors without further action by the stockholders. These terms may include preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion rights, redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of any preferred stock could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock, and therefore could reduce the value of such common stock. In addition, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell assets to, a third party. The ability of the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock could make it more difficult, delay, discourage, prevent or make it more costly to acquire or effect a change-in-control, which in turn could prevent our stockholders from recognizing a gain in the event that a favorable offer is extended and could materially and negatively affect the market price of our common stock.                      We are dependent for our success on a few key employees and consultants.   Our inability to retain these individuals and attract additional people that we will need to maintain and grow our business would impede our business plan and growth strategies. This would have a negative impact on our business and the value of your investment. Our success depends on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our management team. Each of those individuals may voluntarily terminate his employment with our Company at any time. Were we to lose one or more of these key individuals, we could be forced to expend significant time and money in the pursuit of a replacement, which would result in both a delay in the implementation of our business plan and the diversion of limited working capital. We do not maintain a key man insurance policy on any of our employees or consultants.         We incur increased costs of being a public company.   Investors should recognize that we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a result of being a public company. In addition, new and changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder (the  Dodd-Frank Act ), as well as under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act ) have created uncertainty for public companies and increased costs and time that boards of directors and management must devote to complying with these rules and regulations, including those promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the Nasdaq Global Select Market regulate corporate governance practices of public companies. We expect compliance with these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and lead to a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities. For example, we are required to adopt internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, we incur additional expenses associated with our SEC reporting requirements.         Our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for so long as we are an not an  accelerated filer  under SEC rules.   Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we file with the SEC as a public company, and generally requires in the same report a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, under the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer a  smaller reporting company  And not an  accelerated filer  within the meaning of the SEC rules.                  CAPITAL MARKET RISKS          We have issued a substantial amount of equity and may need additional capital, and the sale of additional shares or other equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders.   We have recently issued a substantial number of shares of our capital stock to raise capital for our business operations. In the future, we may raise additional capital for our business operations by issuing equity securities, resulting in the further dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. Any future issuance of our equity securities may dilute then-current stockholders  ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the fair market value of our equity securities, because our assets would be owned by a larger pool of outstanding equity. We may need to raise additional capital through public or private offerings of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common or preferred stock. We may also issue such securities in connection with hiring or retaining employees and consultants (including stock options issued under our equity incentive plans), as payment to providers of goods and services, in connection with future acquisitions or for other business purposes. Such issuances may have a further dilutive effect. Also, the future issuance of any such additional shares of common stock or other securities may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that any such future issuances will not be at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of the common stock are then traded.         Trading on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.   Since October 24, 2016, our common stock has been quoted on the OTCQB tier of the electronic quotation system operated by OTC Markets. Trading in stock quoted on the OTC Markets is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC Markets is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Markets is often more sporadic than the trading of securities on a stock exchange like the Nasdaq or American. Accordingly, shareholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares and the lack of liquidity may negatively impact our ability to pursue strategic alternatives.         Penny stock rules will limit the ability of our stockholders to sell their stock.   The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define  penny stock  to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and  accredited investors.  The term  accredited investor  refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.         The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has adopted sales practice requirements which may also limit a shareholder s ability to buy and sell our stock.   In addition to the penny stock rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that, in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative, low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative, low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for its shares.                      Volatility of the market price of our common stock could adversely affect our shareholders and us.   The market price of our common stock has been subject to fluctuations in the past and may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, including the following:                             Actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results of those of our competitors;                         Announcements by us or our competitors of new and enhanced products;                         Developments or disputes regarding proprietary rights;                         Introduction and adoption of new industry standards;                         Market conditions or trends in our industry;                             Announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions;                         Entry by us or our competitors into joint ventures or partnerships with our competitors;                         Additions or departures of key personnel;                           Political or economic conditions, such as a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations or political events; and                        Other events or factors in any of the countries in which we do business, including war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, or responses to such events.          In addition, in recent years the stock market has been highly volatile. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may materially adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares, regardless of our performance. In the past, following periods of market volatility, shareholders have often instituted securities class action litigation relating to the stock trading and price volatility of the company in question. If we were involved in any securities litigation, it could result in substantial cost to us to defend and divert resources and the attention of management from our business.         We may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms, which could have a material adverse impact on the market value of our common stock.   Security analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of our common stock since there is no incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. The absence of such coverage limits the likelihood that an active market will develop for our common stock. It will also likely make it more difficult to attract new investors at times when we require additional capital.          We may be unable to list our common stock on NASDAQ or on any securities exchange.   Although we may apply to list our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market or on the NYSE American stock market, in the future, we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the initial qualitative or quantitative listing standards, including the minimum per share price and minimum capitalization requirements, or that we will be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on either of those or any other trading venue. Until such time as we qualify for listing on a national securities exchange, our common stock will continue to trade on OTC Markets or another over-the-counter quotation system where an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of shares or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. In addition, rules promulgated by the SEC impose various practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities that fail to meet certain criteria set forth in those rules to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, these rules may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our common stock, which may further affect the liquidity of our common stock. It would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital.          Future sales of our equity securities could put downward selling pressure on our securities, and adversely affect the stock price.   There is a risk that this downward pressure may make it impossible for an investor to sell his or her securities at any reasonable price, if at all. Future sales of substantial amounts of our equity securities in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could put downward selling pressure on our securities, and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.         We do not intend to pay cash dividends.   Our policy is to retain earnings, if any, for use in our business and, for this reason, we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future.         Item 1B   Unresolved staff comments          None                   Item 2   Properties         The Company leases corporate and warehouse facilities (the  Facility Leases ) in San Diego aggregating 8,654, square feet. Our corporate offices are located at 2620 Financial Court, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92117. This Facility Lease commenced in August 2015 and is for a term of 84 months. The current monthly rental payment, net of utilities and operating expenses for the Facility Lease, is approximately $12,979.         Item 3   Legal Proceedings         During fiscal year 2018, the Company began a voluntary internal investigation into payments made with respect to the Company s primary stock sales and whether the payments complied with Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The Company paid a bonus to certain members of its franchise sales staff and to the Company s Chairman for any shares of the Company s stock that potential franchisees purchased.  In this regard, the Company paid approximately $332,000 to its franchise sales staff and a matching bonus of approximately $332,000 to its Chairman for the time period July 2017 to April 2018.  The Company also paid an outside service provider pursuant to a written contract for franchise reengagement leads.  The Company has determined that the outside service provider had some involvement in generating reengagement leads of potential franchisees who also may have had an interest in purchasing stock.  These payments are in relation to the $16.4 million (net of offering costs) raised by the Company during the fiscal year. The Company has engaged outside counsel, has ceased and will not make further payments with regard to the Company s stock sales, will take remedial measures (including oversight and education), and, as deemed appropriate, will take steps to recapture the value of those payments previously made. The Audit Committee will take charge of and oversee the continued internal investigation and remediation efforts.  The Company cannot reasonably estimate any potential liability or recovery, if any, related to these payments.       The Company is also subject to normal and routine litigation and other legal actions by current or former franchisees, employees, and vendors. We assess contingencies to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss for potential accrual in its financial statements. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. The Company regularly reviews contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Although we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, liquidity or financial position of the Company, it is possible they could be materially affected in any particular future reporting period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters or contingencies.         Item 4   Mine Safety Disclosures         Not applicable.                  Part II           Item 5   Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities         Our common stock trades publicly on the OTCQB under the symbol  VEND.  The OTCQB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter equity securities. The OTCQB securities are traded by a community of market makers that enter quotes and trade reports. This market is extremely limited and any prices quoted may not be a reliable indication of the value of our common stock. On September 26, 2018, the closing price of our common stock as reported on the OTCQB was $1.30 per share. Our stock began trading on the OTCQB under the symbol  GEEM  on August 26, 2013 and was later changed to  VEND  on September 19, 2013.                    Holders of Record        As of October 17, 2018, 71,046,504 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding, and held by approximately 350 stockholders of record.        Transfer Agent and Registrar        Our common shares are issued in registered form. VStock Transfer, LLC, 18 Lafayette Place, Woodmere, NY 11598. Telephone: (212) 828-8436 is the registrar and transfer agent for our common shares.        Dividends        We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. For the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. We are not aware of any agreement or contract that limits or restricts the payment of dividends.         Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds        During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, the Company issued 13,528,675 shares aggregating approximately $5,774,000, net of issuance costs of approximately $1,196,000. Subsequent to June 30 and through the date of this report, the Company issued an additional 832,000 shares aggregating approximately $1,248,000.       In instances where we issued securities in reliance upon Regulation D, we relied upon Rule 506 of Regulation D. The parties who received the securities in such instances made representations that such party (a) is acquiring the securities for his, her or its own account for investment and not for the account of any other person and not with a view to or for distribution, assignment or resale in connection with any distribution within the meaning of the Securities Act, (b) agrees not to sell or otherwise transfer the purchased shares unless they are registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws, or an exemption or exemptions from such registration are available, (c) has knowledge and experience in financial and business matters such that the purchaser is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in us, (d) had access to all of our documents, records, and books pertaining to the investment and was provided the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers regarding the terms and conditions of the offering and to obtain any additional information which we possessed or were able to acquire without unreasonable effort and expense, and (e) has no need for the liquidity in its investment in us and could afford the complete loss of such investment. Management made the determination that the investors in instances where we relied on Regulation D are accredited investors (as defined in Regulation D) based upon management s inquiry into their sophistication and net worth. In addition, there was no general solicitation or advertising for securities issued in reliance upon Regulation D.       In instances where we indicate that we relied upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act in issuing securities, our reliance was based upon the following factors: (a) the issuance of the securities was an isolated private transaction by us which did not involve a public offering; (b) there were only a limited number of offerees, each of whom was deemed in our view to be an  accredited investor  within the meaning of federal securities laws; (c) there were no subsequent or contemporaneous public offerings of the securities by us; and (d) the securities were not broken down into smaller denominations.                     Purchase of Securities by issuer or Affiliates        None.         Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans        The table below sets forth information as of June 30, 2018, with respect to compensation plans under which our common stock is authorized for issuance.       On August 14, 2013, our Board of Directors approved the adoption of the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2013 Plan ). The 2013 Plan was approved by a majority of our shareholders (as determined by shareholdings) on September 4, 2013. The 2013 Plan provides for granting of stock-based awards including: incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock bonuses and rights to acquire restricted stock. The total number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to stock awards under the 2013 Plan were initially not exceed in the aggregate 2,600,000 shares of the common stock of our Company. On July 13, 2015, the Company increased the total number of shares that may be issued under the 2013 Plan to 4,000,000 and on April 28, 2016, that number increased to 6,000,000.                               Number of     securities to be     issued upon     exercise of     outstanding                      Weighted-     average     exercise price     of outstanding                      Number of      securities     remaining     available for     future issuance      under equity     compensation                  Plan Category               options                      options                      plan                                                                                          2013 Plan                  3,141,876                 $   0.21                          483,124                    Item 6   Selected Consolidated Financial Data         Disclosure not required as a result of our Company s status as a smaller reporting company.         Item 7   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations          The following discussion and analysis is intended as a review of significant factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes presented herein. In addition to historical information, the following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Such factors include, among others, those set forth herein and those detailed from time to time in our other Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) filings. These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.                   Our MD A consists of the following sections:                             Overview   a general description of our business and fiscal 2018 highlights.                         Results of operations.                         Liquidity and capital resources.                         Discussion of critical accounting estimates.                         Off balance sheet arrangements.                         New accounting pronouncements.            Overview         Generation Next Franchise Brands Inc. primarily develops and operates franchise concepts as well as related technology. Generally, the franchise business model allows other individuals or companies (franchisees) to own and operate businesses using the trademarks, intellectual property, expertise, ideas, and processes that are owned and developed by another company (the franchisor). Franchise concepts owned or developed by the Company are held and operated by various subsidiaries, who become the franchisor, such as Reis   Irvy s Inc., a franchise concept involving robotic soft serve vending robots. As such, the Company s segments are Reis   Irvy s, Fresh Healthy Vending, LLC, and all other operations.       Not all of the Company s business opportunities will strictly involve a franchise business model. In some instances the Company may seek to license the rights to its robotic vending technology or seek revenue from a combination of the license and sale of its robotic vending technology. To date, the Company has not recognized any license revenue or entered into any such agreement. In other instances the Company may license the rights to another company to become the franchisor of the Company s franchise concepts.        On December 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ) with Robofusion, Inc. ( RFI ), whereby the Company acquired the intellectual property assets of RFI, a developer of robotic-kiosk vending technology, primarily frozen yogurt and ice cream vending robots, using RFI's trademarked name of Reis   Irvy's (the  Acquisition ). The Company considered the guidance in ASC 805,  Business Combinations,  and determined the transaction was a purchase of an assets. As a result, the estimated fair of the assets acquired were capitalized. The intent of the purchase was to combine robotics and artificial intelligence platforms to facilitate the manufacture of an unattended robot in order to disrupt traditional frozen yogurt and ice cream retail establishments and, on a larger scale, establish ourselves as an industry leader in the emerging and fast-growing space of unattended retail. Since acquisition, we have developed a state-of-the art robotic soft serve vending robot that is a completely unique vending machine and entertainment experience. The robot accepts cash, credit cards, and is the first of its kind to accept bitcoin. A proprietary software platform is utilized that allows us to readily monitor the sales of our franchisees  and our corporate-owned machines, which assists our franchisees and us in facilitating the management and maintenance of the vending robot. In order to protect the Company s rights, several U.S. and international patents have been approved and granted. Our vending standards are UL (  Underwriters Laboratories  ) (approval in process), NSF (  National Sanitation Foundation  ) recognized (approved in August 2018), and National Automated Merchandising Association (  NAMA )  certified (approved in September 2018), which we believe are among the highest standards in the industry. NAMA estimates that 100 million Americans will use one of seven million vending machines each day. This ensures food temperature compliance, which includes auto-contingency processes should electrical or hardware malfunction; it also ensures that ambient air stays within specified parameters at all times. Our third-party cashless payment technology provides the highest level of data and network security compliance while ensuring complete transparency. As a result, our robotic soft serve vending robots will contain minimal amounts of cash. All transactions are managed by third parties to facilitate financial compliance with local and national laws and regulations. Funds from all electronic transactions are collected by Reis   Irvy s and remitted to the franchisee within ten days of the subsequent month.        As of the date of this report, the Company sold 1,417 units representing approximately $59 million in vending robots and franchise fees. For the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company had recognized approximately $137,000 from the sale of vending robots and approximately $14,000 in franchise fees, respectively. No revenues from licenses were earned or recognized, and royalty revenue was considered immaterial. Further, the Company has contractual commitments for approximately 3,200 units representing approximately $128 million in potential revenue. As of the date of this report, the Company installed and delivered 75 vending robots to franchisees in various locations throughout the United States.       Previous to our current focus of vending frozen yogurt robots, we were a franchisor of vending machines and operator of Company-owned vending machines and micro markets that made healthy eating more convenient through access to high quality healthy foods at high foot traffic vending destinations. As of March 2016, we began to wind down the marketing our healthy vending franchises, although we continue to support our ongoing franchisees. Furthermore, we have sold our corporate route and no longer operate our own healthy vending machines. As of September 28, 2018, FHV LLC has executed an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors under California law, whereby all of the assets of FHV LLC have been assigned to a third party fiduciary who will expeditiously liquidate such assets and distribute the proceeds thereof to FHV LLC s creditors pursuant to the priorities established and permitted by law.       Historical discussions with respect to our Company s operations included herein refer to our operations for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. Effective as of July 19, 2013 our Company acquired all assets of FHV Cal which included FHV LLC in a transaction accounted for as a reverse acquisition. With the sale of the GEEM Business under the Indemnity Agreement effective July 22, 2013, our continuing operations are those of FHV LLC, The Fresh and Healthy Vending Corp, Reis   Irvy s, Inc., Generation Next Vending Robots, Inc. and 19 Degrees, Inc. Forward looking information and discussion with respect to our Company s operations subsequent to the FHV Acquisition is also included herein. Because it was determined as of September 28, 2018, that the assets of FHV LLC are currently insufficient to satisfy FHV LLC s obligations to creditors, FHV LLC has executed an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors under California law, whereby all of the assets of FHV LLC have been assigned to a third party fiduciary who will expeditiously liquidate such assets and distribute the proceeds thereof to FHV LLC s creditors pursuant to the priorities established and permitted by law.                  We have effected changes to our operations in order to restore our previous levels of revenues enjoyed in prior years in the hope that such changes will also position our Company for future growth in fiscal 2019 and beyond. During fiscal year 2018 and through September 28, 2018, the following accomplishments achieved:                                 We delivered and installed 75 robotic soft serve vending kiosks through the date of this report;                                     Reis   Irvy s has entered into contracts for the establishment of over 280 franchises;                                     Through franchise agreements, exclusive territory franchise agreements, and international master franchise agreements Reis   Irvy s has entered into contracts for the sale of over 4,650 robotic soft serve vending kiosks;                                     The Company raised proceeds totaling approximately $16.3 million in the form of an equity offering, net of offering costs of approximately $2 million;                                     We repaid approximately $1.3 million in debt principal during fiscal year 2018 and converted approximately $443,000 of notes payable into 2,767,782 shares of common stock;                                     The Company completed the fiscal year with $10 million in cash and $3.7 million in restricted cash;                                     The Company completed the fiscal year with total assets of $31.9 million, compared to $18 million in the prior fiscal year;                                     Five -time Major Golf Champion Phil Mickelson and his career-long business manager and business partner Steve Loy entered into a business relationship with Reis   Irvy s to become franchisees in San Diego, and to cooperate in certain promotional activities for the promotion of the Company, including the Reis   Irvy s brand in exchange for a reduced purchase price for their robots.                                      The Company entered into an exclusive franchise territory agreement for the city of Atlanta, Georgia. The agreement provides for the exclusive right on all locations within the city of Atlanta and requires the franchisee to purchase a minimum of 500 robotic soft serve vending kiosks in order to maintain exclusive territorial rights. The potential revenues from the sale of the frozen yogurt and ice cream robot and franchise fees are $21 million, not including revenue from royalties, provided that all parties perform on the terms and obligations of the contract;                                     The Company entered into a master franchise agreement for the exclusive rights to sell Reis   Irvy s franchises in Australia. The exclusive agreement requires the master franchisor to purchase 500 robotic soft serve vending kiosks over a period of 5 years. The potential revenues from the sale of the frozen yogurt and ice cream robot and franchise fees are $18 million, provided that all parties perform on the terms and obligations of the contra;                                     The Company entered into an exclusive franchise territory agreement for the Miami-Dade metropolitan area. The agreement provides for the exclusive right on all locations in the Miami-Dade metropolitan area and requires the franchisee to purchase a minimum of 500 robotic soft serve vending kiosks from Reis   Irvy s in order to maintain exclusive territorial rights. . The potential revenues from the sale of the frozen yogurt and ice cream robot and franchise fees are up to $21.3 million, not including revenue from royalties, provided that all parties perform on the terms and obligations of the contract;                                     The Company entered into an exclusive franchise territory agreement for the city of Los Angeles and the County of Orange in California. The agreement provides for the exclusive right on all locations within the city of Los Angeles and Orange County and requires the franchisee to purchase a minimum of 588 robotic soft serve vending kiosks from Reis   Irvy s. The potential revenues from the sale of the frozen yogurt and ice cream robot and franchise fees are $23.2 million, not including revenue from royalties, provided that all parties perform under the terms and obligations of the contract;                                     The Company entered into a master franchise agreement for the exclusive rights to sell Reis   Irvy s franchises in Israel and Oman. These agreements require the master franchisors to purchase 150 robotic soft serve vending kiosks over a period of five years. The potential revenues from the sale of the frozen yogurt and ice cream robot and franchise fees are $5.5 million, not including revenue from royalties, provided that all parties perform under the terms and obligations of the contract;                                     The Company entered into a master franchise agreement for the exclusive rights to sell Reis   Irvy s franchises in Canada. The agreement requires the master franchisor to purchase 500 robotic soft serve vending kiosks over a period of 5 years. The potential revenues from the sale of the frozen yogurt and ice cream robot and franchise fees is $17.1 million, not including revenue from royalties, provided that all parties perform under the terms and obligations of the contract;                                     The Company entered into an exclusive franchise territory agreement for the state of Pennsylvania. The agreement provides the franchisee with exclusive rights to own a Reis   Irvy s franchise within the state of Pennsylvania and requires the franchisee to purchase a minimum of 100 robotic soft serve vending kiosks from Reis   Irvy s. The potential revenues from the sale of the frozen yogurt and ice cream robot and franchise fees is $4.1 million, not including revenue from royalties, provided that all parties perform under the terms and obligations of the contract;           However, there can be no assurances that all or some of the potential revenue from the franchise agreements stated above will be realized.                      Results of Operations          Revenues         Reis   Irvy s        We had revenue of approximately $175,000 for the year ended June 30, 2018, compared to approximately $23,000 revenue for the year ended June 30, 2017. This represents an increase in revenues of approximately $152,000 or 660%. The increase was due to the installation of the first 4 frozen yogurt and ice cream robots in June 2018. The revenue for the year ended June 30, 2017, was primarily the result of a forfeited deposit.         FHV        We had revenues of approximately $550,000 for the year ended June 30, 2018, compared to revenues of approximately $4,114,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017. This represented a decrease in revenues of approximately $3,564,000 or 87%. This decrease was primarily a result of decreased revenues from the installation of vending machines, as we wound down operations of FHV LLC. As of September 28, 2018, the Company assigned its interest in FHV LLC for the benefit of creditors.        Cost of revenues         Reis   Irvy s         Cost of revenues was approximately $120,000 for the year ended June 30, 2018, as compared to no cost of revenues for the year ended June 30, 2017. Cost of revenues is directly proportional to revenues. As a result, the increase was due to the installation of the first 4 frozen yogurt and ice cream robots in June 2018.        FHV        Cost of revenues was approximately $182,000 during the year ended June 30, 2018, as compared to approximately $1,960,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017. This represents a decrease of approximately $1,778,000 or 91%. Cost of revenues is directly proportional to revenues. As a result, this decrease was primarily a result of decreased revenues from the installation of vending machines, as we wound down operations of FHV LLC. As of September 28, 2018, the Company assigned its interest in FHV LLC for the benefit of creditors.        Gross margin         Reis   Irvy s        Gross margin for the year ended June 30, 2018, was approximately $55,000, compared to none for the year ended June 30, 2017, representing an increase of approximately $55,000.        FHV        Gross margin for the year ended June 30, 2018 was approximately $71,000 compared to approximately $2,154,000 for the year ended June 30, 2017, representing a decrease of approximately $2,083,000 or 97%.        Operating expenses        Personnel compensation increased approximately $678,000 to approximately $4,741,000 in fiscal year 2018 as compared to approximately $4,0630,000 in fiscal year 2017, representing an increase of 17%. The increase was primarily due to additional personnel for the increase in the number of franchisees, and an increase in commissions in connection with an increase in pre-bookings for our robotic soft serve vending kiosks.       Marketing and advertising increased approximately $2,231,000, or 97%, to approximately $4,521,000 in fiscal year 2018 as compared to approximately $2,290,000 in fiscal year 2017. The increase was a result of an increase in national radio advertising, internet marketing, and the number of trade shows in order to market Reis   Irvy s robotic soft serve vending robots and attract additional franchisees.       Professional fees decreased approximately $668,000 to approximately $551,000 in fiscal year 2018 compared to approximately $1,219,000 in fiscal year 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased legal fees associated with franchise legal matters as well as previous legal fees associated with the acquisition of the Robofusion assets.        Research and development fees increased approximately $3,547,000 to $5,185,000 in fiscal year 2018 compared to approximately $1,637,000 in fiscal year 2017. The increase was related to the complete redesign and development of the Company s next generation frozen yogurt robot. As a result of the research and development, we shipped our first redesigned units in June 2018.       The provision for legal settlement decreased approximately $644,000 to approximately $413,000 in fiscal year 2018 compared to approximately $1,057,000 in fiscal year 2017. The decrease was primarily due to two large settlements by FHV in fiscal year 2017.                 Provision for income taxes        During the years ended June 30, 2018, and 2017, we incurred net losses and operated as a C-Corp for federal and state income tax purposes. Accordingly, we are subject to federal and state income taxes at the prescribed statutory rates. A valuation allowance has been recorded to eliminate the tax benefit arising from our net operating losses due to the substantial uncertainty about whether such benefit will ever be realized. We anticipate that our provision for income taxes in the future will be significantly higher should we operate profitably under our current structure.        Net loss        Our net loss was approximately $19.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2018 compared to a net loss of approximately $11.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2017. This represents an increase in net loss of approximately $8.3 million or 73%. Basic and diluted net loss per share for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 was $0.41 and $0.39, respectively.         Liquidity and Capital Resources          For the year ended June 30, 2018 we had a net loss totaling approximately $19.5 million with negative cash flows from operations totaling approximately $3.0 million. Our cash balance at June 30, 2018 was approximately $10 million. Since the date of the closing of the FHV Acquisition, our sales were less than anticipated and the resulting cash flows from franchise sales were not sufficient to cover expenditures associated with our daily operations resulting in a substantial decrease in our cash balances and an increase in our outstanding debt. Also, we used cash on hand to retire liabilities associated with the franchise rescissions, for research and development expenditures related to our robotic soft serve vending kiosks and for the purchase of robot inventory. In order to ensure sufficient liquidity for our continuing operations, we will require additional capital financing in the form of either debt or equity (or a combination thereof) financing. During fiscal year 2018 and through the date of this report, the Company raised approximately $17.6 million through a Private Placement Memorandum for the sale of common stock. Furthermore, the Company anticipates generating a significant amount of our required capital resources from deposits on sales of new franchises and royalties from existing and future franchise installs.If additional funds are required, management believes that it will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to the Company, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful.         Our current plans include research and development expenditures for the production of the next generation robot, as well as research and development expenditures for new franchise concepts, payments required for the purchase of the Robofusion intellectual property (previous owner of the frozen yogurt robot intellectual property), expenditures for the purchase of robotic soft serve vending kiosks and repurchase of machines from franchisees opting to rescind their franchise agreements. Given our current cash position, we may be forced to curtail our plans by delaying or suspending the production and purchase of robotic soft serve vending kiosks until such time that we may able to prepay for the robots       As of June 30, 2018, the Company had the following amounts of debt outstanding: $250,000 for the convertible secured note payable; $1.3 million for the Robofusion note payable; approximately $297,000 for the secured promissory note to a related party; and approximately $240,000 convertible promissory note to a related party.                  Critical Accounting Estimates         We have identified the following as our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results, and that require management s most subjective and complex judgments. Information regarding our other significant accounting estimates and policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.        Revenue recognition      Our primary revenue generating transactions will come from the sale of franchises and robotic soft serve vending kiosks to the franchisees. There are no franchise fees charged beyond the initial first year franchise fees. We receive ongoing royalty fees, which represent other revenues in the Company s financial statements, as a percentage of either franchisees  gross revenues or gross margins on vending machine sales. We also receive rebates on purchases of products made by our franchisees.       We recognize revenues and associated costs in connection with franchisees (machines and franchise fees) at the time that we have substantially performed or satisfied all material services or conditions relating to the franchise agreement. We consider substantial performance to have occurred when: 1) no remaining obligations are unfulfilled under the franchise agreement; 2) there is no intent to refund any cash received or to forgive any unpaid amounts due from franchisees; 3) all of the initial services spelled out in the franchise agreement have been performed; and 4) we have met all other material conditions or obligations. The Company recognizes revenue on product sales of Company-owned machines when products are purchased; we receive electronic sales records on our Company-owned units.       The Company records the amount of a franchise sale, machines and franchise fees, as deferred revenue until the conditions above have been met. Once the machines are installed, the Company records the corresponding machine and franchise fee as revenue, on a pro rata basis based on the number of machines installed relative to the total machines purchased.       The Company records the value of company-owned machines as inventory when purchased. Once the machines are installed, the machine value is transferred to fixed assets and depreciated over its useful life.       It is not our policy to allow for returns, discounts or warranties to our franchisees. Under certain circumstances, including as the result of regulatory action, our Company may become obligated to offer our franchisees amounts in rescission to reacquire their existing franchises, including machines. Additionally, if our Company is unable to fulfill its obligations under a franchise agreement we may, at our sole discretion, agree to refund or reduce part or all of a franchisees payments or commitments to pay. As of June 30, 2018, and 2017, the Company s provision for franchisee rescissions and refunds totaled approximately $2,420,000 and $2,493,000, respectively. There are vending warranties extended by the machine manufacturer and its distributors but required repairs to the machines are the responsibility of the franchisees. To the extent the vending machines remain under warranty, our franchisees transact directly with the manufacturer or its distributor. Our robotic soft serve vending kiosks include a one-year warranty from the Company. Extended parts warranties beyond the initial year may be purchased for an additional cost by the franchisee.          Reis   Irvy s Franchise contracts      We invoice franchisees in full at the time that we enter into contractual arrangements with them. Payment terms vary but usually a significant portion of the contract s cash consideration (typically 40% - 50% of machines plus 50% - 100% of the franchise fees) is due at the time of signing, while remaining amounts outlined under the contract are generally due upon the securing of locations and/or prior to shipment of the machines.                Amounts invoiced to franchisees for which we have not met the criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above, are deferred until such conditions are met. Therefore, these amounts are accounted for as contract assets   due from franchisees and customer advances and deferred revenues, respectively in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of June 30, 2018, the Company had contract assets   due from franchisees and customer advances and deferred revenues totaling approximately $7,251,000 and $37,737,000, respectively. As of June 30, 2017, the Company had contract assets   due from franchisees, and customer advances and deferred revenues totaling approximately $12,631,000, and $25,043,000 respectively.         Accounts receivable, net      Accounts receivable arise primarily from invoices for customer deposits, product royalties and annual advertising fees and are carried at their estimated collectible amounts, net of any estimated allowances for doubtful accounts. We grant unsecured credit to our customers deemed credit worthy. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed and potential credit losses estimated by management are charged to operations on a regular basis. At the time, any particular account receivable is deemed uncollectible, the balance is charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Our allowance for doubtful accounts aggregated approximately $174,000 and $198,000 at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.        Share-based Compensation    We offer share-based compensation plans to attract, retain and motivate key officers, non-employee directors and employees to work toward the financial success of the Company. Share-based compensation cost for our stock option grants is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair-value as calculated by an option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period. The option pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly, share-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.        Legal accruals    The Company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business. A determination of the amount accrued, if any, for these contingencies is made after analysis of each matter. We continually evaluate such accruals and may increase or decrease accrued amounts, as we deem appropriate. Because lawsuits are inherently unpredictable, and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgment about future events. As a result, the amount of ultimate loss may differ from those estimates.        Income taxes    We estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes. These estimates include, among other items, depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes, allowable tax credits, effective rates for state and local income taxes and the tax deductibility of certain other items. We adjust our effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available. Our estimates are based on the best available information at the time that we prepare the income tax provision. We generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year-end. Income tax returns are subject to audit by federal, state and local governments, generally years after the returns are filed. These returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws.        Valuation of options and warrants    We separately value warrants to purchase common stock when issued in connection with notes payable using a binomial quantitative valuation method. The value of such warrants is recorded as a discount from the related notes payable and credited to additional paid-in capital at the time of the issuance of the related notes payable. The value of the discount is applied to the note payable and amortized over the expected term of the note payable using the interest method with the related accretion charged to operations.       We account for our share-based compensation as required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) under authoritative guidance ASC 718 on stock compensation, using a binomial quantitative valuation method. The resulting compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements on a straight-line basis over the vesting period from the date of grant.       Share grants are measured using a fair value method with the resulting compensation cost recognized in the financial statements. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period for the stock awards.                     Fair value of financial instruments    The Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:       Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.       Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.       Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.       The Company monitors the market conditions and evaluates the fair value hierarchy levels at least quarterly. For any transfers in and out of the levels of the fair value hierarchy, the Company elects to disclose the fair value measurement at the beginning of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred.       The Company s financial instruments consisted of cash, cash in escrow, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, provision for franchisee rescissions and refunds, accrued personnel expenses, due to related party and notes payable. The estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximate the carrying amount due to the short maturity of these instruments. The recognition of the derivative values of convertible debt are based on the weighted-average binomial option pricing model.        Fair value of financial instruments    In April 2008, the FASB issued a pronouncement that provides guidance on determining what types of instruments or embedded features in an instrument held by a reporting entity can be considered indexed to its own stock for the purpose of evaluating the first criteria of the scope exception in the pronouncement on accounting for derivatives. This pronouncement was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of these requirements can affect the accounting for many convertible instruments with provisions that protect holders from a decline in the stock price. Each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether convertible debt to acquire stock of the Company contains provisions that protect holders from declines in the stock price or otherwise could result in modification of the conversion price under the respective convertible debt agreements. The Company determined that the conversion feature in the convertible notes issued contained such provisions and recorded such instruments as derivative liabilities. See Note 6, Notes payable.        Off Balance Sheet Arrangements        Not applicable for small reporting companies.                  New Accounting Pronouncements        In July 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330) Related to Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  which applies to all inventory except that which is measured using last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) or the retail inventory method. Inventory measured using first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost is within the scope of the new guidance and should be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The new guidance is applied prospectively, and earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company adopted ASU 2015-11 effective July 1, 2017, which had no material impact on its consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures.       In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued new guidance for goodwill impairment which requires only a single-step quantitative test to identify and measure impairment and record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value. The option to perform a qualitative assessment first for a reporting unit to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary does not change under the new guidance. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2020 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance in fiscal year 2017. The adoption of this guidance will had no impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.       In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash  ( ASU 2016-18 ). ASU 2016-18 requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning of period and end of period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows, and transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are no longer presented within the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-18 for the reporting period ended December 31, 2017 and the standard was applied retrospectively for all periods presented which had no material impact on prior years. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-18, the Company no longer presents the change within restricted cash in the consolidated statement of cash flows.        In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued new guidance for employee share-based compensation which simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including excess tax benefits, forfeiture estimates, statutory tax withholding requirements, and classification in the statements of cash flows. This guidance was effective for the Company in fiscal year 2017. Under the new guidance any future excess tax benefits or deficiencies are recorded to the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations, instead of additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, no excess tax benefits were recorded to additional paid-in capital that would have been recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes.       In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance for lease accounting, which replaces existing lease guidance. The new guidance aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. This guidance is effective for the Company in fiscal year 2019 with early adoption permitted, and modified retrospective application is required. The Company expects to adopt this new guidance in fiscal year 2019 and is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company expects that substantially all of its operating lease commitments (see Note 8) will be subject to the new guidance and will be recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption.                In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue requirements in  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)  and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The New Revenue Standard provides for a single comprehensive principles-based standard for the recognition of revenue across all industries through the application of the following five-step process:       Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.   Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.   Step 3: Determine the transaction price.   Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.   Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.       This five-step process will require significant management judgment in addition to changing the way many companies recognize revenue in their financial statements. Additionally, and among other provisions, the New Revenue Standard requires expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue.       In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  ( ASU 2015-14 ), which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date. The Company s adoption of ASU 2014-09 will change the timing of the recognition of initial franchise fees. ASU 2014-09 requires these fees to be recognized over the term of the related franchise license for the respective robot, which had a material impact to revenue recognized for initial franchise fees and renewal franchise fees. ASU 2014-09, allows for non-cancellable franchise contract agreements for the Company recognize revenue under the provisions of ASC 606-10-25, Revenue Recognition   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.       In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments in this update change the accounting for certain stock-based compensation transactions, including the income tax consequences and cash flow classification for applicable transactions. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 31, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on its consolidated financial statements.       In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ),  Leases (Topic 842) , which supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases in  Leases (Topic 840)  and generally requires all leases, including operating leases, to be recognized in the statement of financial position as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities by lessees. The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach and are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; early adoption is permitted. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10   Codification Improvements of Topic 842, Leases   and ASU No. 2018-11,  Leases (Topic 842 ):  Targeted Improvements.   ASU 2018-11 provides companies another transition method in addition to the existing transition method by allowing entities to initially apply the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. The consideration in the contract is allocated to the lease and nonlease components on a relative standalone price basis (for lessees) or in accordance with the allocation guidance in the new revenue standard (for lessors). ASU 2018-11 also provides lessees with a practical expedient, by class of underlying asset, to not separate nonlease components from the associated lease component. If a lessee makes that accounting policy election, it is required to account for the nonlease components together with the associated lease component as a single lease component and to provide certain disclosures. Lessors are not afforded a similar practical expedient. The Company is evaluating the effect ASU 2016-02, 2018-10 and 2018-11 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures and has not yet determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting at this time.       Effective January 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15  Statement of Cash Flows  (Topic 230). This guidance clarifies diversity in practice on where in the Statement of Cash Flows to recognize certain transactions, including the classification of payment of contingent consideration for acquisitions between Financing and Operating activities. We are currently evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements.       On January 5, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01,  Clarifying the Definition of a Business  (Topic ASC 805), guidance to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments in this ASU provide a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities (collectively referred to as a  set ) is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. This screen reduces the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated. If the screen is not met, the amendments require that to be considered a business, a set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace the missing elements. This ASU is effective for public business entities in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. We are currently evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements.       In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation  (Topic 718) - Scope of Modification Accounting. This ASU clarifies when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. This ASU is effective prospectively for the annual period ending December 31, 2018 and interim periods within that annual period. We are currently evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements.       In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13,   Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement  , which adds disclosure requirements to Topic 820 for the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. The Company is evaluating the provisions of this ASU and plans to adopt this ASU effective July 1, 2020.                  Item 7A   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk         Disclosure not required as a result of our Company s status as a smaller reporting company.         Item 8   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Included on page F-1 within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.          Item 9   Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure         On January 15, 2018, the Company s Board of Directors dismissed Anton   Chia, LLP as the Company s independent registered public accountants, and engaged Benjamin   Young, LLP.       During the Company s fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, there were no disagreements between the Company and Benjamin   Young, LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Benjamin   Young LLP s satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with their reports on the Company s financial statements for such years or periods; and there were no reportable events as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.       During the Company s fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 and through January 15, 2018, there were no disagreements between the Company and Anton   Chia, LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Anton   Chia LLP s satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with their reports on the Company s financial statements for such years or periods; and there were no reportable events as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.         Item 9A   Controls and Procedures           Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures         We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Management has designed our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.       As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), we have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our management, and the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2018.       Based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10K, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not deemed effective in order to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure (see below for further discussion).                  Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting         Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a- 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). We recognize that because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.       To evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria described in Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (  COSO  )   1992, as amended in 2013.       In connection with management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, we determined that as of June 30, 2018, there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due the lack of an audit committee. Since the Company is not listed on a national exchange or on an automated interdealer quotation system, it is not required to have an audit committee or indep e ndent directors, and thus did not have a controlling independent board or audit committee. We consider this to be a material weakness as an independent board and audit committee provide important oversight. Subsequent to June 30, 2018, the Company remediated the material weakness by establishing an audit and a compensation committee and appointing two independent directors, with at least one having financial expertise to be the Audit Chairman. The Company determined that there may be a material weakness related to the identification of transactions that could be deemed violations of Section 13(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), and Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The specific material weaknesses identified by the Company s management as of end of the period covered by this report include the following:                         we have not performed a risk assessment and mapped our processes to control objectives;                            we have not implemented comprehensive entity-level internal controls;                            we have not implemented adequate system and manual controls; and                            we do not have sufficient segregation of duties. As such, the officers approve their own related business expense reimbursements          Despite the material weaknesses reported above, our management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented and that this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report.       The Company remediated this material weakness by adding qualified personnel to the accounting department, and developing and implementing internal controls to eliminate such transactions.          Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting         There were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a- 15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred as of June 30, 2018, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.       Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018. Our management s evaluation of our internal control was based on the framework in Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the  COSO Framework   1992, as amended in 2013 ). Based on its evaluation under the  Internal Control - Evaluation Framework,  due to the material weakness described above, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2018. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Board in the normal course of their duties.       This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to a permanent exemption for non-accelerated filers from the internal control audit requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.         Officers  Certifications         Appearing as exhibits to this Annual Report are  Certifications  of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

In evaluating director nominees, we principally consider the following among other business and personal factors:                             The appropriate size of the Board;                                                 Our needs with respect to the particular talents and experience of our directors;                                                 The knowledge, skills and experience of nominees;                                                 Experience with accounting rules and practices; and                                                 The nominees  other commitments.          Our goal is to assemble a Board of Directors that brings our Company a variety of perspectives and skills derived from high quality business, professional and personal experience. Personal integrity is a necessary requirement for every member of our Board.       There are no family relationships among any of our officers or directors.

The compensation committee will be primarily responsible for reviewing and approving our salary and benefits policies and other compensation of our executive officers. The nominating committee would be primarily responsible for nominating directors and setting policies and procedures for the nomination of directors.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance        Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock and other equity securities.

Item 12 - Security  Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters        The following table sets forth, as of September 10, 2018 information with respect to the securities holdings of (i) our officers and directors, and (ii) all persons which, pursuant to filings with the SEC and our stock transfer records, we have reason to believe may be deemed the beneficial owner of more than five percent (5%) of the Common Stock. The securities  beneficially owned  by an individual are determined in accordance with the definition of  beneficial ownership  set forth in the regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and, accordingly, may include securities owned by or for, among others, the spouse and/or minor children of an individual and any other relative who resides in the same home as such individual, as well as other securities as to which the individual has or shares voting or investment power or which each person has the right to acquire within 60 days through the exercise of options or otherwise. Beneficial ownership may be disclaimed as to certain of the securities. This table has been provided accounting for all equity common stock issuances as of September 10, 2018.             ____________         (1)      Unless otherwise noted, the address is c/o Generation NEXT Franchise Brands, Inc. 2620 Financial Court, Suite 100, San Diego California 92117.         (2)      Percentage of class beneficially owned is calculated by dividing the amount and nature of beneficial ownership by 52,756,939 shares, deemed to be the total shares of common stock outstanding as of the date of this table.         (3)      15,648,298 shares are owned by a trust of which Mr. Yates is an affiliate, 488,556 shares are owned by Mr. Yates personally, 48,379 shares are owned by the spouse of Mr. Yates and 500,000 shares are available through the exercise of options.         (4)      Amount include shares granted to Mr. Budman under an initial employment agreement dated October 1, 2014.

This summary also includes transactions of FHV LLC, a legal entity acquired in connection with the FHV Acquisition since July 1, 2012. We believe the terms obtained or consideration that we paid or received, as applicable, in connection with the transactions described below were comparable to terms available or the amounts that would be paid or received, as applicable, in arm s-length transactions.        Notes Payable to Socially Responsible Brands        The Company issued two Secured Promissory Notes and a related Security Agreement, each dated October 27, 2015 (the  Notes  and  Security Agreement ). Certain current lien holders of the Company also executed and delivered a Subordination Agreement in connection with the issuance of the Notes and Security Agreement (the  Subordination Agreement , and together with the Notes and Security Agreement, the  Transaction Documents ).       The Notes are each in the principal amount of $250,000, and have terms of eighteen months and one year, respectively. The first Note is secured by the Company s fifty (50) corporate-owned micro-markets and the Note principal and interest is repaid according to a schedule based on sale of such micro-markets. The second Note is secured by the Company s franchise royalties and principal and interest is repaid on a schedule based on receipt of combo machine sales, with guaranteed payments of at least $75,000 per quarter during the term of the Note. During the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company did not make any payments of principal or interest under the Notes. During the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company paid approximately $116,000 and $34,000 of principal and interest, respectively, under the Notes.       On January 20, 2017, Socially Responsible Brands agreed to extend the maturity date on their note until December 31, 2017. In connection with the loan extension, the holder may convert their Notes into shares of the Company s stock at $.16 per share. Furthermore, on September 18, 2017, the Notes were amended whereby the interest rate was modified to a rate of 20% per annum effective October 1, 2016 and the maturity date was further extended until December 31, 2018. Mr. Yates, the CEO and Chairman of the Company, is the 20% owner of Socially Responsible Brands.        Notes Payable to Nick Yates        On January 13, 2015, the Company's Chairman, Nicholas Yates, agreed to loan the Company up to $200,000 (the "Loan"), each incremental borrowing under the Loan to be evidenced by a promissory note. Mr. Yates further agreed to loan the Company up to $550,000. Amounts borrowed under the Loan bear interest at 10% per annum and are due on December 31, 2016. The Loan also provides for conversion to common stock, at the option of the holder, at a price equal to the Company s next round of funding. In connection with the beneficial conversion option, the Company has recorded $300,000 as a discount on the Loan and charged $193,766 and 106,234, to operations during the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of June 30, 2018, and 2017, approximately $240,000 and $353,000, respectively were outstanding under the Loan.       On January 20, 2017, Mr. Yates agreed to extend his loans until December 31, 2017. In exchange for extending the loans, Mr. Yates was granted an option to convert the loan to common stock at $.16 per share. Furthermore, the maturity date on the loans was extended until December 31, 2018.       On January 20, 2017, the Company executed a loan agreement with Nine Dragons Investments ( Nine Dragons ) for borrowings in an amount not to exceed $300,000. Nine Dragons is an entity affiliated with our Chairman Nick Yates. In connection with the loan agreement, the Company borrowed proceeds aggregating $209,931. The loans bear interest at 10% per annum, are due on December 31, 2017 and are secured by certain assets of the Company, including its intellectual property. Furthermore, the loans are convertible at the option of the holder at $.16 per share. During the year ended June 30, 2017, $209,931 of the Nine Dragons loans were redeemed for cash.        Other Transactions        The Company paid a bonus to its Chairman. Please see Note 7 of Item 11 for a more complete description of the bonus.       In July 2017, the Company issued 150,000 shares of common stock in connection with settlement of a former franchisee. Terms of the agreement state that Nick Yates will receive 50% of the proceeds in excess of $200,000.       The spouse of the Company s Chairman was employed by the Company during 2017 and through May 31, 2018. The Company charged approximately $38,000 and $40,000 to operations for her compensation in 2018 and 2017, respectively.       As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying balance sheet included approximately $28,000 and $14,000, respectively, of short-term advances to an officer of the Company.        As of June 30, 2017, prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying balance sheet included approximately $21,000, from a loan to an officer of the Company. During the year ended June 30, 2018, the loan was repaid in-full.        The Company determined that there may be a material weakness related to the identification of transactions that could be deemed violations of Section 13(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), and Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.                  Director Independence        The Company believes that Mr. Finley was independent as the term  independent  is defined by the rules of NASDAQ Rule 5605. Furthermore, the Board believes that Ms. Lavette and Mr. Maudlin are also considered  independent  by the rules NASDAQ Rule 5605. The Company has no related transactions with its independent directors. The other members of the Company s Board of Directors, Art Budman and Nick Yates, are officers of the Company and are not considered by the Company to be independent directors.         Review, approval or ratification of transactions with related persons        We do not have any other special committee, policy or procedure related to the review, approval or ratification of related party transactions.         Item 14   Principal Accounting Fees and Services         The aggregate fees billed for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of our annual financial statements and review of the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for these fiscal periods were as follows:             _________         (1)      Audit fees consist of fees incurred for professional services rendered for the audit of our financial statements, for reviews of our interim financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and for services that are normally provided in connection with statutory or regulatory filings or engagements.         (2)      Audit-related fees consist of fees billed for professional services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our consolidated financial statements, but are not reported under  Audit fees.          (3)      Tax fees consist of fees billed for professional services relating to tax compliance, tax planning, and tax advice.          Our Board of Directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the board of directors either before or after the respective services were rendered.       Our Board of Directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by our independent auditors and believes that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining our independent auditors  independence.

Opinion on the Financial Statements        We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Generation Next Franchise Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of June 30, 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders  deficit, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the  financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.        Basis for Opinion        These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ( PCAOB ) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.       We conducted our audit in accordance with the auditing standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.       Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.       /s/ Benjamin   Young, LLP       We have served as the Company's auditor since 2018.    Irvine CA, California   October 19, 2018                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM         To the Board of Directors and Stockholders       Generation Next Franchise Brands, Inc.   (Formerly Fresh Healthy Vending International, Inc.)       We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Generation Next Franchise Brands, Inc. (Formerly Fresh Healthy Vending International, Inc.) (the  Company ) as of June 30, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders  deficit and cash flows for each of the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.       We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company has determined that it is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.       In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2017, and the consolidated results of its operations, its changes in stockholders  deficit and its cash flows for each of the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.         /s/ Anton   Chia, LLP                                Newport Beach, California   September 29, 2017                    F-3

         Table of Contents              GENERATION NEXT FRANCHISE BRANDS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES      (FORMERLY KNOWN AS FRESH HEALTHY VENDING INTERNATIONAL, INC.)     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements         1. Organization and description of business        Generation NEXT Franchise Brands, Inc. (formerly known as Fresh Healthy Vending International, Inc. and referred to herein collectively with its subsidiaries as "we", the "Company", "our Company", or "GNext") operates through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Fresh Healthy Vending LLC ("FHV LLC"), The Fresh and Healthy Vending Corporation, FHV Acquisition Corp. ("FHV Acquisition"), Reis   Irvy s, Inc. ( R I ), 19 Degrees, Inc. and Generation Next Vending Robots, Inc. as a franchisor, direct seller and owner and operator of robotic soft serve vending kiosks, healthy drink and snack vending machines and micro markets that feature cashless payment devices and remote monitoring software. The Company uses in-house location specialists that are responsible for securing locations for its franchisees; additionally, the Company has negotiated discounts with a national product distribution chain. The Company also operates its own frozen yogurt equipment. Effective May 2016, the Company shifted focus away from franchise sales of its healthy drink and snack vending machines and micro markets. We will no longer market our vending machines and micro markets to new franchisees. Because it was determined the assets of FHV LLC are currently insufficient to satisfy FHV LLC s obligations to creditors, as of September 28, 2018, FHV LLC has executed an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors under California law, whereby all of the assets of FHV LLC have been assigned to a third party fiduciary who will expeditiously liquidate such assets and distribute the proceeds thereof to FHV LLC s creditors pursuant to the priorities established and permitted by law.       During fiscal year 2017, we obtained the exclusive rights to sell a new frozen yogurt vending robot, branded Reis   Irvy s. As of the date of this report, we have received approval to sell franchises in a number of states in the U.S. and Canada and have booked a net 1,417 units aggregating approximately $59 million in customer advances-due from franchisees and contract liabilities- franchisees advances and deferred revenues, prior to certain offset adjustments aggregating 10.3 million. As of June 30, 2018, and through the date of this report, the Company has delivered and installed 75 frozen yogurt vending machines. The Company has redeveloped the next generation frozen yogurt robot and has spent $5.2 million in research and development expenses through June 30, 2018. The Company anticipates it will continue to incur additional research and development expenses throughout fiscal 2019.       On December 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ) with Robofusion, Inc. ( RFI ), whereby the Company acquired the intellectual property assets of RFI, a developer of robotic-kiosk vending technology, primarily frozen yogurt and ice cream vending robots, using RFI's trademarked name of Reis   Irvy's (the  Acquisition ). The Company considered the guidance in ASC 805,  Business Combinations,  and determined the transaction was a purchase of an asset. As a result, the estimated fair of the assets acquired were capitalized. The intent of the purchase was to combine robotics and artificial intelligence platforms to facilitate the manufacture of an unattended robot in order to disrupt traditional frozen yogurt and ice cream retail establishments and, on a larger scale, establish ourselves as an industry leader in the emerging and fast-growing space of unattended retail. Since acquisition, we have developed a state-of-the art robotic soft serve vending robot that is a completely unique vending machine and entertainment experience. The robot accepts cash, credit cards, and is the first of its kind to accept bitcoin. A proprietary software platform is utilized that allows us to readily monitor the sales of our franchisees  and our corporate-owned machines, which assists our franchisees and us in facilitating the management and maintenance of the vending robot. In order to protect the Company s rights, several U.S. and international patents have been approved and granted. Our vending standards are UL (  Underwriters Laboratories  ) (approval in process), NSF (  National Sanitation Foundation  ) recognized (approved in August 2018), and National Automated Merchandising Association (  NAMA )  certified (approved in September 2018), which we believe are among the highest standards in the industry. This ensures food temperature compliance, which includes auto-contingency processes should electrical or hardware malfunction; it also ensures that ambient air stays within specified parameters at all times. Our third-party cashless payment technology provides the highest level of data and network security compliance while ensuring complete transparency. As a result, our robotic soft serve vending robots will contain minimal amounts of cash. All transactions are managed by third parties to facilitate financial compliance with local and national laws and regulations. Funds from all electronic transactions are collected by Reis   Irvy s and remitted to the franchisee within ten days of the subsequent month.        2. Summary of significant accounting policies        This summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating the Company s financial statements. The consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of the Company s management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.                    F-8        
         Table of Contents             Basis of Accounting        The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (  GAAP  ) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (  SEC  ).        Liquidity and capital resources        For the year ended June 30, 2018 we had a net loss totaling approximately $19,536,000 with negative cash flows from operations totaling approximately $2,967,000. Our cash balance at June 30, 2018 was approximately $10,044,000. Since the date of the closing of the FHV Acquisition, our sales were less than anticipated and the resulting cash flows from franchise sales were not sufficient to cover expenditures associated with our daily operations resulting in a substantial decrease in our cash balances and an increase in our outstanding debt. Also, we used cash on hand to retire liabilities associated with the franchise rescissions, for research and development expenditures related to our robotic soft serve vending kiosks and for the purchase of robot inventory. In order to ensure sufficient liquidity for our continuing operations, we will require additional capital financing in the form of either debt or equity (or a combination thereof) financing. During fiscal year 2018 and through the date of this report, the Company raised approximately $17.6 million through the sale of common stock. Furthermore, the Company anticipates generating a significant amount of our required capital resources from deposits on sales of new franchises and royalties from existing and future franchise installs. If additional funds are required, management believes that it will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to the Company, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful.       Our current plans include research and development expenditures for the production of the next generation robot, payments required for the purchase of the Robofusion intellectual property (previous owner of the frozen yogurt robot intellectual property) capital expenditures for the purchase of corporate-owned and operated robotic soft serve vending kiosks as well as the repurchase of machines from franchisees opting to rescind their franchise agreements. Given our current cash position, we may be forced to curtail our plans by delaying or suspending the production and purchase of robotic soft serve vending kiosks until such time that we may able to prepay for the robots.         Principles of consolidation        The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Reis   Irvy s, Inc., FHV LLC, 19 Degrees, Inc., Generation Next Vending Robots, The Fresh and Healthy Vending Corporation, and FHV Acquisition, Corp. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.        Reclassification        Certain amounts in the 2017 financial statements have been reclassed to conform with the 2018 presentation.        Use of estimates        The preparation of our Company s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues, costs and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates include our provisions for bad debts, franchisee rescissions and refunds, legal estimates, stock based compensation, derivative liability and the valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets. It is at least reasonably possible that a change in the estimates will occur in the near term.                    F-9        
         Table of Contents             Cash and cash equivalents        All investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents primarily represent funds invested in money market funds, bank certificates of deposit and U.S. government debt securities whose cost equals fair market value. We had no cash equivalents at June 30, 2018 and 2017. We may maintain our cash and cash equivalents in amounts that may, at times, exceed federally insured limits. At June 30, 2018, bank balances, per our bank, exceeding federally insured limits totaled approximately $9,201,000. We have not experienced any losses with respect to cash, and we believe our Company is not exposed to any significant credit risk with respect to our cash.       Certain states require the Company to maintain customer deposits in escrow accounts until the Company has substantially performed its obligations. Furthermore, certain franchisees have elected to pay their remaining balance due directly to an escrow account for the beneficiary of the Company s contract manufacturer and inventory suppliers. At June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company had approximately $3,712,000 and $1,000, respectively maintained in escrow accounts for these purposes.        Accounts receivable, net         Accounts receivable arise primarily from royalties and are carried at their estimated collectible amounts, net of any estimated allowances for doubtful accounts. We grant unsecured credit to our customers (located throughout North America, the Bahamas and Puerto Rico) deemed credit worthy. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed and potential credit losses estimated by management are charged to operations on a regular basis. At the time any particular account receivable is deemed uncollectible, the balance is charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Our allowance for doubtful accounts aggregated approximately $174,000 and $198,000 at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.        Inventory        Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using the average cost method.        Property and equipment        Property and equipment are carried at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of the individual assets, generally five to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful life of the asset. Costs incurred for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and expenditures for major replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated remaining useful lives.         Intangible assets        Intangible assets consist primarily of patents, trademarks and trade names. Amortization of intangible assets is recorded as amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations and amortized over the respective useful lives using the straight-line method.        Impairment of long-lived assets        Impairment losses are recognized on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets  carrying amount. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the estimated fair value of the assets. There were no impairments of long-lived assets for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.                 Deferred rent        The Company entered into an operating lease for our corporate offices in San Diego, California that contains provisions for future rent increases, leasehold improvement allowances and rent abatements. We record monthly rent expense equal to the total of the payments due over the lease term, divided by the number of months of the lease term. The difference between the rent expense recorded and the amount paid is credited or charged to deferred rent, which is reflected as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.         Derivatives and Hedging        In April 2008, the FASB issued a pronouncement that provides guidance on determining what types of instruments or embedded features in an instrument held by a reporting entity can be considered indexed to its own stock for the purpose of evaluating the first criteria of the scope exception in the pronouncement on accounting for derivatives. This pronouncement was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of these requirements can affect the accounting for many convertible instruments with provisions that protect holders from a decline in the stock price. Each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether convertible debt to acquire stock of the Company contains provisions that protect holders from declines in the stock price or otherwise could result in modification of the conversion price under the respective convertible debt agreements. The Company determined that the conversion feature in the convertible notes issued contained such provisions and recorded such instruments as derivative liabilities.        The fair value of derivative instruments is recorded and shown separately under current liabilities. Changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations under other income (expenses).       The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record the embedded conversion option and warrants at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as a non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification.       The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instruments are initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses the Black-Sholes option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date.         Revenue, contract liabilities   franchisees advances and deferred revenue, and contract assets   due from franchisees         The Company relies upon ASC 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , to recognize revenue, contract liabilities-deposits from franchisees and contract assets-due from franchisees.        Reis   Irvy s, Inc        The primary revenue sources consisted of the following:                          Robotic soft serve vending kiosks                   Franchise fees.                   Revenues from robotic soft serve vending kiosks and franchise fees are recognized when the Company has substantially performed or satisfied all material services or conditions relating to the franchise agreement. Substantial performance has occurred when: 1) no remaining obligations are unfulfilled under the franchise agreement; 2) there is no intent to refund any cash received or to forgive any unpaid amounts due from franchisees; 3) all of the initial services in the franchise agreement have been performed; and 4) all other material conditions or obligations have been met. In June 2018, four robotic soft serve vending kiosks were installed and operational, and the Company had no further material conditions or obligations. During the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized revenue of approximately $137,000 for robotic soft serve vending kiosks and approximately $14,000 in franchise fees.       Upon the execution of a franchise agreement, a deposit from the franchisee is required, and generally consists of 40% - 50% of the sales price of the frozen yogurt and ice cream robots, 50% - 100% of the initial franchise fees, and 40% - 50% of location fees. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes the contract as a contract liability   customer deposits and deferred revenue when the Company receives consideration or is due consideration. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company s customer advances and deferred revenues were approximately $37,737,000 and $25,043,000, respectively.        The Company recognizes contract assets   due from franchisees when the Company has an unconditional right to consideration. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company s contract assets   due from franchisees was approximately $7,251,000 and $12,632,000, respectively.        Fresh Healthy Vending, LLC        The primary revenue sources consisted of the following:                          Vending machine sales.                   Franchise fees.                   Monthly royalties.          Revenues from vending machine sales and franchise fees are recognized when the Company has substantially performed or satisfied all material services or conditions relating to the franchise agreement. Substantial performance has occurred when: 1) no remaining obligations are unfulfilled under the franchise agreement; 2) there is no intent to refund any cash received or to forgive any unpaid amounts due from franchisees; 3) all of the initial services in the franchise agreement have been performed; and 4) all other material conditions or obligations have been met. During 2018 the Company recognized approximately $178,000 of vending machine sales and approximately $15,000 in franchise fees. During 2017 the Company recognized approximately $3,347,000 of vending machine sales and approximately $307,000 in franchise fees.       Revenue from monthly royalties are recognized when earned. During 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized royalties of approximately $296,000 and $372,000, respectively.        Net agency revenues for the sales of food and beverages are recognized when earned. During 2018 and 2017, approximately $60,000 and $89,000, respectively was recognized for net agency revenues.       Upon the execution of a franchise agreement, a deposit from the franchisee is required, and generally consists of 40% of amounts due for vending machines plus 100% of the initial franchise fees. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes the contract as a contract liability   deposits from franchisees and sales taxes payable when the contract is signed.        The Company recognizes contract assets   due from franchisees when the contract is executed. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized no contract assets   due from franchisees.       Because it was determined the assets of FHV LLC are currently insufficient to satisfy FHV LLC s obligations to creditors, as of September 28, 2018, FHV LLC has executed an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors under California law, whereby all of the assets of FHV LLC have been assigned to a third party fiduciary who will expeditiously liquidate such assets and distribute the proceeds thereof to FHV LLC s creditors pursuant to the priorities established and permitted by law.                 19 Degrees        The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products from company-owned robotic soft serve vending kiosks when pro ducts are purchased. During 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized approximately $166,000 and $141,000, respectively.        The Company recognizes the value of company-owned machines as inventory when purchased. Subsequent to installation, the purchased cost is recognized in fixed assets and depreciated over its estimated useful life. As of June 30, 2018, there were four company-owned robotic soft serve vending kiosks included in fixed assets.        Generation Next Vending Robots        The Company recognizes revenue from the direct sale of robotic soft serve vending kiosks when the machines are installed and operational. During 2018 and 2017, there were no revenues from the direct sale of robots.        It is not the Company s policy to allow for returns, discounts or warranties to our franchisees. Under certain circumstances, including as the result of regulatory action, the Company may become obligated to offer our franchisees amounts in rescission to reacquire their existing franchises, including the robotic soft serve vending kiosks Additionally, if the Company is unable to fulfill its obligations under a franchise agreement the Company may, at its sole discretion, agree to refund or reduce part or all of a franchisees payments or commitments to pay.        As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company s provision for Reis   Irvy s franchisee rescissions and refunds totaled approximately $2,420,000 and $2,492,000, respectively. The balance is based on executed termination agreements and an estimate of future terminations.         Marketing and advertising        Marketing and advertising costs are expensed as incurred. There are no existing arrangements under which the Company provides or receives marketing and advertising services from others for any consideration other than cash. Marketing and advertising expense totaled approximately $4,520,000 and $2,289,000 for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.        Freight costs and fees        Outbound freight charged to customers is recorded as revenue. The related outbound freight costs are considered period costs and charged to cost of revenues.        Research and Development Costs        Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. For the year ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded approximately $5,184,000 and $1,637,000, respectively.        Income taxes        The Company provides for income taxes utilizing the liability method. Under the liability method, current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or refundable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or liability is computed for the expected future impact of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax credits. Tax rate changes are reflected in the computation of the income tax provision during the period such changes are enacted.                Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in management s opinion, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The Company s valuation allowance is based on available evidence, including its current year operating loss, evaluation of positive and negative evidence with respect to certain specific deferred tax assets including evaluation sources of future taxable income to support the realization of the deferred tax assets. The Company has established a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, and therefore has not recognized any income tax benefit or expense (other than the state minimum income tax) for the periods presented.       ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740 ), clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements. ASC 740 provides that a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions may be recognized when it is more-likely-than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. ASC 740 also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.       The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. There is no accrual for interest or penalties for income taxes on the balance sheets as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the Company has not recognized interest and/or penalties in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.         Valuation of options and warrants to purchase common stock and share grants        Warrants to purchase common stock are separately valued when issued in connection with notes payable using a binomial quantitative valuation method. The value of such warrants is recognized as a discount from the related notes payable and credited to additional paid-in capital at the time of the issuance of the related notes payable. The value of the discount is applied to the note payable and amortized over the expected term of the note payable using the interest method with the related accretion charged to interest expense.       Share-based compensation to employees is recognized in accordance with ASC 718, using a binomial quantitative valuation method. The resulting compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements on a straight-line basis over the vesting period from the date of grant.       Share-based compensation to non-employees is recognized in accordance with ASC 505, at the estimated fair value until the options or warrants have vested. The resulting compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period from the date of grant.       Share grants are measured using a fair value method with the resulting compensation cost recognized in the financial statements. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period for the stock awards.        Concentration of credit risk        The Company is subject to credit risk through its accounts receivable consisting primarily of amounts due from franchisees for royalty income, and other products. The financial condition of these franchisees is largely dependent upon the underlying business trends of our brands and market conditions within the vending industry. This concentration of credit risk is mitigated, in part, by the large number of franchisees spread over a large geographical area and the short-term nature of the receivables.        Concentration of manufacturers        Vending machines and micro markets are supplied by a single manufacturer. Although there are a limited number of manufacturers of vending machines and micro markets, we believe that other suppliers could provide similar machines on comparable terms. A change in suppliers, however, could cause a delay in deliveries and a possible loss of sales, which could adversely affect the Company s operating results. Additionally, robotic soft serve vending kiosks are manufactured by one supplier; a change in suppliers could cause a delay in deliveries and possible loss of sales, which could adversely affect the Company s operating results.       Vending food products are primarily supplied by one national distributor. Although there are a limited number of product suppliers with the product selection and distribution capabilities required by the franchise network, other distributors could provide similar products on comparable terms. The Company, and its franchisees, also use supplemental suppliers for their product selections, in addition to the national distributor. A change in suppliers, however, could cause a delay in deliveries and a possible loss of revenue from both current and prospective franchisees, which could adversely affect the Company s operating results.       See Note 11 for purchase commitments from our manufacturers for inventory.                  Fair value of financial instruments        The Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:       Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.       Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.        Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The Company determined that the derivative liability was a level 3, as the inputs used to determine the estimated fair value were unobservable.       The Company monitors the market conditions and evaluates the fair value hierarchy levels at least quarterly. For any transfers in and out of the levels of the fair value hierarchy, the Company elects to disclose the fair value measurement at the beginning of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred.       The Company s financial instruments consisted of cash, cash in escrow, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, provision for franchisee rescissions and refunds, accrued personnel expenses, due to related party and notes payable. The estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximate the carrying amount due to the short maturity of these instruments. The recognition of the derivative values of convertible debt are based on the weighted-average Black-Scholes option pricing model.        Net loss per share        The Company calculates basic earnings per share ( EPS ) by dividing our net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without considering common stock equivalents. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income or net loss and comprehensive net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period and the weighted average number of dilutive common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents are only included in the calculation of diluted EPS when their effect is dilutive.         Segment Information        The Company relies upon ASC 280,  Segment Reporting,  to determine and disclose reportable operating segments, and is organized such that each subsidiary represents a different operating purpose. As a result, the Company analyzed each subsidiary to determine reportable operating segments. In its management of operations, the chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Office, Nicholas Yates and Chief Financial Officer, Arthur Budman, reviews subsidiary balance sheets and income statements prepared on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP.        For the periods presented, the Company determined that Reis and Irvy s, Inc., and FHV, LLC were reportable operating segments, and aggregated Generation Next Franchise Brands, Inc., 19 Degrees, Inc., Generation Next Vending Robots, The Fresh and Healthy Vending Corporation, FHV Acquisition, Corp. and FHV Acquisition, Corp. into the reportable operating segment  Other.  Reis   Irvy s, Inc. represents the sale of frozen yogurt and ice cream robots, franchise fees, royalties (12% of gross revenue) and location fees. FHV, LLC represents the sale of fresh and healthy vending machines, franchise fees and royalties.                  Franchise information        Franchise statistics for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:                  Franchise agreements generally also provide for continuing royalty fees that are based on monthly gross revenues of each machine. The royalty fee (generally 6% - 12% of gross revenues) compensates our Company for various advisory services and certain merchant fees that we provide to the franchisee on an on-going basis.       New franchisees are generally required to purchase a minimum of three robotic soft serve vending kiosks, or ten vending machines or micro markets. Initial franchise fees are primarily intended to compensate our Company for granting the right to use our Company s trademark and tradenames and patents and to offset the costs of finding locations for vending machines, developing training programs and the operating manual. The term of the initial franchise agreement is generally five to ten years. Options to renew the franchise for additional terms are available for an additional fee.         Related Party Transactions         The Company has been involved in transactions with related parties. A party is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management, and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party.      Recent accounting standards       In July 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330) Related to Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  which applies to all inventory except that which is measured using last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) or the retail inventory method. Inventory measured using first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) or average cost is within the scope of the new guidance and should be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The new guidance is applied prospectively, and earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company adopted ASU 2015-11 effective July 1, 2017, which had no material impact on its consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures.       In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued new guidance for goodwill impairment which requires only a single-step quantitative test to identify and measure impairment and record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value. The option to perform a qualitative assessment first for a reporting unit to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary does not change under the new guidance. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2020 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance in fiscal year 2017. The adoption of this guidance will had no impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.       In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash  ( ASU 2016-18 ). ASU 2016-18 requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning of period and end of period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows, and transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are no longer presented within the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2016-18 for the reporting period ended December 31, 2017 and the standard was applied retrospectively for all periods presented which had no material impact on prior years. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-18, the Company no longer presents the change within restricted cash in the consolidated statement of cash flows.        In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued new guidance for employee share-based compensation which simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including excess tax benefits, forfeiture estimates, statutory tax withholding requirements, and classification in the statements of cash flows. This guidance was effective for the Company in fiscal year 2017. Under the new guidance any future excess tax benefits or deficiencies are recorded to the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations, instead of additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, no excess tax benefits were recorded to additional paid-in capital that would have been recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes.       In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ),  Leases (Topic 842) , which supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases in  Leases (Topic 840)  and generally requires all leases, including operating leases, to be recognized in the statement of financial position as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities by lessees. The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach and are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; early adoption is permitted. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10   Codification Improvements of Topic 842, Leases   and ASU No. 2018-11,  Leases (Topic 842 ):  Targeted Improvements.   ASU 2018-11 provides companies another transition method in addition to the existing transition method by allowing entities to initially apply the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. The consideration in the contract is allocated to the lease and nonlease components on a relative standalone price basis (for lessees) or in accordance with the allocation guidance in the new revenue standard (for lessors). ASU 2018-11 also provides lessees with a practical expedient, by class of underlying asset, to not separate nonlease components from the associated lease component. If a lessee makes that accounting policy election, it is required to account for the nonlease components together with the associated lease component as a single lease component and to provide certain disclosures. Lessors are not afforded a similar practical expedient. The Company is evaluating the effect ASU 2016-02, 2018-10 and 2018-11 will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures and has not yet determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting at this time.                In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue requirements in  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)  and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. The New Revenue Standard provides for a single comprehensive principles-based standard for the recognition of revenue across all industries through the application of the following five-step process:       Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.   Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.   Step 3: Determine the transaction price.   Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.   Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.       This five-step process will require significant management judgment in addition to changing the way many companies recognize revenue in their financial statements. Additionally, and among other provisions, the New Revenue Standard requires expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue.       In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  ( ASU 2015-14 ), which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date. The Company s adoption of ASU 2014-09 will change the timing of the recognition of initial franchise fees. ASU 2014-09 requires these fees to be recognized over the term of the related franchise license for the respective robot, which had a material impact to revenue recognized for initial franchise fees and renewal franchise fees. ASU 2014-09, allows for non-cancellable franchise contract agreements for the Company recognize revenue under the provisions of ASC 606-10-25, Revenue Recognition   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.       In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments in this update change the accounting for certain stock-based compensation transactions, including the income tax consequences and cash flow classification for applicable transactions. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 31, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on its consolidated financial statements.       In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases.  This standard requires the recognition of all lease transactions with terms in excess of 12 months on the balance sheet as a lease liability and a right-of-use asset (as defined in the standard). ASU 2016-02 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. Upon adoption, the lessee will apply the new standard retrospectively to all periods presented or retrospectively using a cumulative effect adjustment in the year of adoption. ASU 2016-02 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements or consolidated financial statement disclosures upon adoption based on current facts and circumstances.       Effective January 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15  Statement of Cash Flows  (Topic 230). This guidance clarifies diversity in practice on where in the Statement of Cash Flows to recognize certain transactions, including the classification of payment of contingent consideration for acquisitions between Financing and Operating activities. We are currently evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements.       On January 5, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01,  Clarifying the Definition of a Business  (Topic ASC 805), guidance to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments in this ASU provide a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities (collectively referred to as a  set ) is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. This screen reduces the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated. If the screen is not met, the amendments require that to be considered a business, a set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace the missing elements. This ASU is effective for public business entities in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. We are currently evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements.       In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation  (Topic 718) - Scope of Modification Accounting. This ASU clarifies when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. This ASU is effective prospectively for the annual period ending December 31, 2018 and interim periods within that annual period. We are currently evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements.       In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13,   Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement  , which adds disclosure requirements to Topic 820 for the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. The Company is evaluating the provisions of this ASU and plans to adopt this ASU effective July 1, 2020.                 3. Inventory        As of June 30, inventory consisted of the following:                    Prepaid inventory represents payments for raw material that has not been received by the Company as of June 30, 2018.       For the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized in the accompanying statement of operations $50,000 in cost of goods sold and $300,000 in research and development expenses for the allowance for obsolete inventory.

Patents        On December 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ) with Robofusion, Inc. ( RFI ), whereby the Company acquired the intellectual property assets of RFI, a developer of robotic-kiosk vending technology, primarily frozen yogurt vending kiosks/cubes, using RFI's trademarked name of Reis   Irvy's (the  Acquisition ). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company provided RFI, and its designees, a cash payment of $440,000, The Company also issued to RFI a three-year, $2 million note and a five-year common stock purchase warrant for 1,520,000 shares with a strike price of $0.50 per share. Furthermore, certain RFI Officers, Directors and Shareholders will be subject to a five-year, non-compete agreement. Also, the Agreement provides for indemnification and set off of up to $1 million, under certain circumstances. For the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company entered into two settlements related to the intellectual property totaling $185,000. As of June 30, 2018, the Company made approximately $135,000 in payments. All settlement payments are a reduction of the note payable. (See Note 6).

Computer software        Computer software represents capitalized costs of the customer relationship management software utilized by the Company.         6. Notes payable        As of June 30, notes payable consisted of the following:                 Maturities of the notes payable, net of discounts, are as follows:                    Senior secured promissory notes        On February 25, 2014, we issued Senior Secured Promissory Notes (the "Initial Notes") to three investors in exchange for cash totaling $501,000. The Initial Notes were set to mature on February 24, 2015 and bear simple interest at a rate of 12% paid monthly over the term of the loan. The Initial Notes also provide that our Company can raise up to $1.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of additional notes (the "Additional Notes") which would have the same seniority and security rights. The Initial Notes are secured by substantially all assets of the Company. On September 23, 2014, the holders of the Company's Initial Notes extended the maturity date from February 24, 2015 to March 15, 2016, and on March 15, 2016, the Notes were further extended to September 30, 2016. The notes aggregating $334,000 have been further extended to December 31, 2018 and $167,000 of the notes, plus accrued interest, were converted to common stock at $.16 per share on January 20, 2017. The remaining outstanding notes, aggregating $334,000, have been granted conversion rights at $.16 per share. The conversion right granted was fixed at the closing trading price of the stock. As a result, the Company determined that the conversion right was not a derivative in accordance with ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedges,  the host instrument was conventional convertible, and that no beneficial conversion feature was present. The modification of the debt terms was not deemed substantive and therefore, was not accounted for as an extinguishment of debt with the recognition of a gain or loss.       As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the outstanding balance was approximately $23,000 and $334,000, respectively.       For the year ended June 30, 2018, approximately $311,000 of principal and $132,000 of accrued interest was converted into approximately 2,767,000 shares of common stock.                 As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, accrued interest was approximately $6,000 and $107,000, respectively.        For the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, interest expense was approximately $31,000 and $40,000, respectively.        Financing and security agreement        On September 23, 2014, the Company entered into a Financing and Security Agreement (the "Financing Agreement") whereby the Company may be able to borrow up to $1.5 million through the issuance of convertible secured debt. The principal terms of the Financing Agreement are as follows:                             The Company may borrow up to $1.5 million in tranches of up to $150,000 each.                                     The first tranche of $150,000 was issued at the closing of the transaction and was used to acquire and put into service Company-owned micro markets. An additional amount of $100,000 was issued during the quarter ended December 31, 2014.                                     All subsequent tranches shall be in the amount of up to $150,000, shall be due and funded by the lender within seven days of notice, and shall be contingent upon the Company placing an additional 20 micro markets into service.                                     The notes payable issued under the terms of the Financing Agreement are due in full 24 months from the funding of each tranche. The Company may, at its discretion, extend the due date for each tranche for an additional 12 months.                                     Interest on the borrowings accrues at a rate of 10% per annum, and is payable quarterly. In the event the Company elects to extend the maturity date of a tranche, the interest rate will increase to 12% per annum on that tranche.                                     The lender may at its discretion convert any outstanding principal under any of the tranches into shares of the Company's common stock. The conversion price is 85% of the average closing prices for the 15 trading days prior to the notice of conversion, but in no event at a conversion price lower than $1.28 per share.                                     On the due date, or the extended due date, the Company may at its discretion convert up to one-half of the outstanding principal into shares of common stock. The conversion price is 85% of the average closing prices for the 15 trading days prior to the due date or extended due date, whichever may be applicable.                                     Borrowings are secured by the Company-owned micro markets.          At June 30, 2018, there was $250,000 outstanding under the Financing Agreement, of which $150,000 originally matured on September 23, 2016 and $100,000 originally matured on December 15, 2016. On January 20, 2017, the Company extended both tranches until December 31, 2018. As part of the extension, the holder was granted conversion rights at $.16 per share. The conversion right granted was fixed at the closing trading price of the stock. As a result, the Company determined that the conversion right was not a derivative in accordance with ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedges,  the host instrument was conventional convertible, and that no beneficial conversion feature was present. The modification of the debt terms was not deemed substantive and therefore, was not accounted for as an extinguishment of debt with the recognition of a gain or loss.                The lender of the Financing Agreement has informed the Company that he does not intend to lend additional amounts under the Financing Agreement.       As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the outstanding balance was approximately $250,000.       As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, accrued interest was approximately $81,000 and $56,000, respectively.          For the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, interest expense was approximately $25,000 and $25,000, respectively.          Convertible promissory note        On June 10, 2015, the Company issued a $600,000 convertible promissory note (the  Promissory Note ) with interest payable at 10% per annum. In connection with the issuance of the Promissory Note, the Company also issued 2,000,000 common stock purchase warrants, with a term of four years, at an exercise price of $.75 per share.        The Promissory Note matures twelve months from issuance, may be extended for an additional three months, and may be converted at any time in whole or in part, at the lesser of:                    (i)      25% discount to the next round of financing prior to conversion in excess of $1 million; or                            (ii)      $.30 per share; or,                            (iii)      Commencing six months after issuance date, at the investor s sole discretion, at a 20% discount to the lowest trading price ten business days prior to conversion.          The Company considered the guidance in ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedging , and ASC 470-40,  Debt With Conversion and Other Options , to account for the warrants and recognized a debt discount and increase in additional paid-in capital at the relative fair value of approximately $78,000. The Company considered the guidance in ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedging , for the conversion feature and recognized a debt discount and derivative liability at the estimated fair value of approximately $401,000. As a result, the total debt discount was approximately $480,000 at issuance. The discount was amortized as an accretion of discount on notes payable over the term of the loan using the effective interest rate method and included in interest expense in the accompanying statement of operations. The change in the estimated fair value of the derivative liability is recognized in the accompanying statement of operations at each reporting period. During the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company has recognized a derivative loss of approximately $220,000 and $224,000 respectively. At June 30, 2017 the Company had a derivative liability related to the Promissory Note of $560,007. During the year ended June 30, 2018, the derivative was eliminated, as the warrants exercise date expired on June 20, 2018. As a result, the estimated fair value of the derivative of as of the date of expiration of approximately $780,000 was recognized in additional paid-in capital in the accompanying statement of changes in shareholders  deficit.        We calculated the value of the discount using the Black-Scholes option pricing model employing the following assumptions: volatility of common stock   76%; risk-free interest rate   0.28%; forfeiture rate   0%; value per share of common stock - $0.45; strike price - $0.75; term   4 years.       The Promissory Note maturity may also be extended for an additional three months. Furthermore, there will be a full ratchet, anti-dilution with respect to the shares of common stock only (no adjustments will be made to the warrants), for any equity or Convertible Debt financing completed or a definitive Term Sheet exercised within twelve months of closing or fifteen months if the Company exercises its one-time extension. The ratchet does not come into effect for any non-convertible debt offering arranged by the Company, its advisors or bankers.       The conversion terms of the Promissory Note were amended pursuant to a first amendment to Promissory Note, dated October 14, 2015. The adjustable pricing mechanism commencing six months after the Promissory Note issuance date at a 20% discount to the lowest trading price 10 business days prior to conversion was removed. The negative covenants set forth in the subscription agreement were also amended pursuant to a first amendment to subscription agreement, dated October 14, 2015. The modification of an embedded conversion feature is separately accounted for as a derivative before the modification, after the modification or both. Since the bifurcated conversion option is accounted for at fair value both before and after the modification, any changes in the fair value of the conversion option would be reflected in earnings. Furthermore, the Promissory Note was extended for an additional six months from the original maturity.                On January 20, 2017, the note was extended through June 30, 2017 and the warrant price was reduced to $.30 per share, provided that the warrants must be exercised for cash. Furthermore, the warrant expiration date was amended to June 20, 2018. As of June 20, 2018, no warrants were exercised. The Company determined that the cash and non-cash effect of the modification was less than 10% in aggregate. As a result, the modification was not deemed substantive and therefore, was not accounted for as an extinguishment of debt, and did not recognition a gain or loss.       During the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, principal payments were $300,000 each year. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the outstanding balance was approximately $0 and $300,000, respectively.       As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, accrued interest was approximately $0 and $24,000, respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, interest payments were approximately $25,000 and $6,000, respectively.       For the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, interest expense was approximately $1,000 and $30,000, respectively.         Robofusion note payable        On December 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ) with Robofusion, Inc. ( RFI ), whereby the Company acquired the intellectual property assets of RFI, a developer of robotic-kiosk vending technology, primarily frozen yogurt vending kiosks/cubes, using RFI's trademarked name of Reis   Irvy's (the  Acquisition ). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company provided RFI, and its designees, a cash payment of $440,000. The Company also issued to RFI a three-year, $2 million note.       In connection with the issuance of the note payable, the Company issued a five-year common stock purchase warrant for 1,520,000 shares with a strike price of $0.50 per share (see Note 5). At inception, the estimated fair value of the warrant was approximately $174,000, and was recognized as a debt discount. For the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, approximately $50,000 and $25,000 was accreted to interest expense in the accompanying statement of operations.       As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the outstanding balance was approximately $1,441,000 and $2,000,000, respectively. During 2018, principal payments were approximately $424,000 and indemnification payments were approximately $135,000.        As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, accrued interest was approximately $15,000 and $0, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2018, interest payments were approximately $45,000.       For the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, interest expense was approximately $60,000 and $30,000, respectively.        Bridge notes payable        On February 28, 2017, the Company executed two short-term bridge notes aggregating $345,000. The notes bear interest at 0% per annum and matured on July 28, 2017. In connection with the note issuances, the Company recognized an original issue discount of approximately $45,000 and a debt discount approximately $57,000 related to the issuance of 75,000 shares of the Company s common stock (Note 7), for a total debt discount of approximately $102,000. The debt discount was amortized over the life of the loan.        During the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, principal payments were approximately $323,000 and $22,000, respectively. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the outstanding balance was approximately $0 and $323,000, respectively.       As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, accrued interest was approximately $0 and $5,000, respectively.       For the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, interest expense was approximately $2,000 and $5,000, respectively.       For the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, approximately $20,000 and $82,000 was accreted to interest expense in the accompanying statement of operations.                 Convertible notes payable        Beginning April 2013 through June 19, 2013, we issued convertible notes payable to three entities or individuals in exchange for cash proceeds totaling approximately $250,000. The notes were unsecured and bore interest at 12% per annum. The notes bore maturity dates ranging from June 30, 2013 to August 31, 2013, the earlier of their being outstanding for 60 days, or upon the transfer of 25% or more of our Company's share ownership or upon our merger with a public company (all as defined in the note agreements). Repayment of the notes was personally guaranteed by the beneficial shareholder of FHV Holdings Corp, a California corporation ("FHV CAL"), a director of our Company. On July 19, 2013, $210,000 of the outstanding balance of the notes was tendered in exchange for 552,418 shares of FHV International's common stock.        During the year ended June 30, 2018, principal payments were approximately $7,000. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the outstanding balance was approximately $0 and $7,000, respectively.        7. Stockholders  deficit        For the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company issued or recognized:                For the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company issued or recognized:                 8. Stock-based compensation          2013 Equity Incentive Plan         On August 14, 2013, our Board of Directors approved the adoption of the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2013 Plan ). The 2013 Plan was approved by a majority of our shareholders (as determined by shareholdings) on September 4, 2013. The 2013 Plan provides for granting of stock-based awards including: incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock bonuses and rights to acquire restricted stock. The total number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to stock awards under the 2013 Plan were initially not to exceed in the aggregate 2,600,000 shares of the common stock of our Company. On July 13, 2015, the Company increased the total number of shares that may be issued under the 2013 Plan to 4,000,000. Furthermore, in April 2016, the Company further increased the total number of shares that may be issued under the Plan to 6,000,000.                During the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company granted stock options under its 2013 Plan. Stock- based compensation related to these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable vesting period and is included in operating expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. During the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, options issued were valued using a binomial valuation method assuming the following:                  The expected volatility was estimated based on the volatility of a set of companies that management believes are comparable to the Company. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury note rate over the expected life of the options. The expected life was determined using the simplified method as we have no historical experience. We recorded stock-based compensation expense of $1,636,000 and $402,000 for the years ended June 30, 2018, and 2017, respectively.       The following table summarizes the stock option activity:                  At June 30, 2018, the total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to options totaled approximately $341,000.       During the year ended June 30, 2017, warrants to purchase 1,520,000 shares at $.50 per share were granted to Robofusion as part of the asset purchase agreement (Note 6). As of June 30, 2018, there were 3,520,000 warrants outstanding, of which 2,000,000 have an exercise price of $.30 per share and 1,520,000 have an exercise price of $.50 per share. The warrants expire five years from the date of grant.                  Non-Qualified Stock Options         For the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company granted non-qualified stock options (outside of the 2013 Plan) aggregating 5,000,000 and 500,000, respectively to its Chairman and CEO. The options vest 50% upon the delivery of 400 robotic soft serve vending kiosks or achieving cumulative revenue of $15 million and 50% upon the delivery of 800 robotic soft serve vending kiosks or achieving cumulative revenue of $30 million.       The estimated fair value of the options was approximately $698,000. Stock-based compensation related to these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected vesting period (24 months) and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. The options issued were valued using a binomial method assuming the following:                  For the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized approximately $279,000 and $116,000, respectively. Remaining stock-based compensation to be recognized is approximately $303,000. No options have vested and the remaining options expected to vest is 4,400,000.       For the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company granted non-qualified stock options (outside of the 2013 Plan) to the following:                          The Company granted a potential of 1,175,000 options to employees. The options vest based on objective criteria consisting of sales and overall Company goals.                                            Furthermore, we granted a potential of 6,375,000 options to the Chairman, CEO and management employees with an exercise price of $0.87 per share. The options vest 50% upon 1,200 units installed or $45 million in cumulative revenue; and 50% upon 2,000 units installed or $75 million in cumulative revenue.            The estimated fair value of the options was approximately $6,464,000. Stock-based compensation related to these awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected vesting period (24 months) and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations . The options issued were valued using a binomial method assuming the following:                For the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized approximately $1,067,000. Remaining stock-based compensation to be recognized is approximately $5,397,000. No options have vested and the remaining options expected to vest is 7,550,000.                 9. Leases        On August 1, 2015, the Company moved its corporate and warehouse facilities to a single location aggregating 8,654 feet at 2620 Financial Court, Suite 100, San Diego California 92117. The new lease is for a term of 84 months. The current monthly rental payment, net of utilities for the facility, is $15,995. Future minimum lease payments under the Company s Facility Lease is as follows:       2018: $191,492; 2019: $196,928; 2020: $202,554; 2021: $208,377; 2022: $214,403: Thereafter: $17,909. Rent expense totaled $230,000 and $229,000 for the years ended June 30 2018 and 2017, respectively.        10. Income taxes        The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, in accordance with ASC 740-10, which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carry-forwards using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit or expense is recognized as a result of changes in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of any deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company had a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets.       The following table presents the current and deferred income tax provision (benefit) for federal, state and foreign income taxes:                          Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown below:                  In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets of $10,158,334 at June 30, 2018 management considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.       A reconciliation of income taxes computed by applying the federal statutory income tax rate of 34% to income (loss) before income taxes to the recognized income tax (benefit) provision reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations is as follows for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:                 During the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the valuation allowance increased by $1,967,000 and $4,107,000, respectively. At June 30, 2018, the Company had federal and state net operating carryforwards of approximately $33,841,000 and 24,719,000 respectively. The federal and state loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2031 unless previously utilized. Our tax returns for the years 2014 - 2017 are open for examination by the taxing authorities.                Utilization of the NOL carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that may have occurred or could occur in the future, as required by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). These ownership changes may limit the amount of the NOL carry forwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an "ownership change" as defined by Section 382 of the Code results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 5 percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain shareholders.       On December 22, 2017, new tax reform legislation in the U.S., known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the  Act ) was signed into law. As a result of the lower enacted corporate tax rate, the Company has remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. The provisional amount recorded related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was $4.8 million that is fully offset by a corresponding decrease to our valuation allowance.       We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition at the effective date to be recognized. As of June 30, 2018 we do not have any unrecognized tax benefits. We do not anticipate a significant change in the unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.                 11. Commitments and contingencies        During fiscal year 2018, the Company began a voluntary internal investigation into payments made with respect to the Company s primary stock sales and whether the payments complied with Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The Company paid a bonus to certain members of its franchise sales staff and to the Company s Chairman for any shares of the Company s stock that potential franchisees purchased.  In this regard, the Company paid approximately $332,000 to its franchise sales staff and a matching bonus of approximately $332,000 to its Chairman for the time period July 2017 to April 2018.  The Company also paid an outside service provider pursuant to a written contract for franchise reengagement leads.  The Company has determined that the outside service provider had some involvement in generating reengagement leads of potential franchisees who also may have had an interest in purchasing stock.  These payments are in relation to the $16.4 million (net of offering costs) raised by the Company during the fiscal year. The Company has engaged outside counsel, has ceased and will not make further payments with regard to the Company s stock sales, will take remedial measures (including oversight and education), and, as deemed appropriate, will take steps to recapture the value of those payments previously made. The Audit Committee will take charge of and oversee the continued internal investigation and remediation efforts.  The Company cannot reasonably estimate any potential liability or recovery, if any, related to these payments.       There are warranties on our vending machines extended by the machine manufacturer and its distributors, but required repairs to the machines are the responsibility of the franchisees. To the extent the machines remain under warranty, our franchisees transact directly with the manufacturer or its distributor. As a result, no warranty liability or expense was recognized in 2018 or 2017. The Company provides a one year parts warranty on its robotic soft serve vending kiosks.       As of June 30, 2018, the Company had unconditional purchase contracts of approximately $12,870,000 for the purchase or inventory for the frozen yogurt and ice cream robots.        On May 19, 2018, the Company entered into an 18 month consulting contract with a franchisee. Consideration is a total of 300,000 shares of common stock. 50,000 shares of common stock vest every three months during the term of the contract. If the consultant resigns or is terminated, the Company has the option to repurchase the vested shares at the lesser of the fair market value of the shares at the time the repurchase option is exercised and the purchase price The Company accounted for the shares in accordance with ASC 505-50,  Equity-Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees . The estimated fair value of the shares was based on the closing trading price on June 30, 2018. The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the shares of common stock. As of June 30, 2018, no shares had vested. For the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized approximately $131,000 of other expense in the accompanying statement of operations.        On June 6, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with two investors in connection with the Company s private placement memorandum. The investors have the right to purchase:                From time to time, we may become involved in litigation and other legal actions, including disagreements with to any pending litigation or franchise agreement rescissions where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Estimated legal costs expected to be incurred to resolve legal matters are recorded to the consolidated balance sheet and statements of operations.        Additionally, our Company is subject to certain state reviews of our Franchise Disclosure Documents. Such state reviews could lead to our Company being fined or prohibited from entering into franchising agreements with the reviewing state.       Periodically, we are contacted by other state franchise regulatory authorities and in some cases have been required to respond to inquiries, or make changes to our franchise disclosure documents or franchise offer and sale practices. Management believes these communications from state regulators and corresponding changes in our franchise disclosure documents and practices are administrative in nature and do not indicate the presence of a loss or probable potential loss.                 12. Related party transactions        Related party debt consisted of the following:                   Notes Payable to Socially Responsible Brands        On October 27, 2015, the Company obtained secured loans in the aggregate amount of $500,000 from Socially Responsible Brands, Inc.

The Company issued two Secured Promissory Notes and a related Security Agreement, each dated October 27, 2015 (the  Notes  and  Security Agreement ). Certain current lien holders of the Company also executed and delivered a Subordination Agreement in connection with the issuance of the Notes and Security Agreement (the  Subordination Agreement , and together with the Notes and Security Agreement, the  Transaction Documents ).       The Notes are each in the principal amount of $250,000, and have terms of eighteen months and one year, respectively.

In connection with the loan extension, the holder may convert their Notes into shares of the Company s stock at $.16 per share. Furthermore, on September 18, 2017, the Notes were amended whereby the interest rate was modified to a rate of 20% per annum effective October 1, 2016. Additionally, the Notes were further extended until December 31, 2018.        Notes Payable to Nick Yates          On January 13, 2015, the Company's Chairman, Nicholas Yates, agreed to loan the Company up to $200,000 (the "Loan"), each incremental borrowing under the Loan to be evidenced by a promissory note. Mr. Yates further agreed to loan the Company up to $550,000. Amounts borrowed under the Loan bear interest at 10% per annum and are due on December 31, 2016. The Loan also provides for conversion to common stock, at the option of the holder, at a price equal to the Company s next round of funding. In connection with the beneficial conversion option, the Company has recorded $300,000 as a discount on the Loan and charged $0 and $194,000, to operations during the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, $240,000 and $353,000, respectively were outstanding under the Loan.       On January 20, 2017, Mr. Yates agreed to extend his loans until December 31, 2017. In exchange for extending the loans, Mr. Yates was granted an option to convert the loan to common stock at $.16 per share. Furthermore, Loans were extended until December 31, 2018.       On January 20, 2017, the Company executed a loan agreement with Nine Dragons Investments ( Nine Dragons ) for borrowings in an amount not to exceed $300,000. Nine Dragons is an entity affiliated with our Chairman Nick Yates. In connection with the loan agreement, the Company borrowed proceeds aggregating $209,931. The loans bear interest at 10% per annum, are due on December 31, 2017 and are secured by certain assets of the Company, including its intellectual property. Furthermore, the loans are convertible at the option of the holder at $.16 per share. During the year ended June 30, 2017, $209,931 of the Nine Dragons loans were redeemed for cash.        Other Transactions          The Company paid a bonus to the Chairman for shares of the Company s stock that potential franchisees purchased. In this regard, the Company paid approximately $332,000 to its Chairman for the time period July 2017 to April 2018. The Company will take steps to recapture the value of these payments previously made to its Chairman.       In July 2017, the Company issued 150,000 shares of common stock in connection with settlement of a former franchisee (see Note 11). Terms of the agreement state that Nick Yates will receive 50% of the proceeds in excess of $200,000.       The spouse of the Company s Chairman was employed by the Company during 2017 and through May 31, 2018. The Company charged approximately $38,000 and $40,000 to operations for her compensation in 2018 and 2017, respectively.       As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying balance sheet included approximately $28,000 and $14,000, respectively, of short-term advances to an officer of the Company.        As of June 30, 2017, prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying balance sheet included approximately $21,000, from a loan to an officer of the Company. During the year ended June 30, 2018, the loan was repaid in-full.

On various dates subsequent to July 1, 2018 and through the date of this report, the Company entered into termination agreements with franchisees for refunds aggregating approximately $428,000. The Company considered the guidance in ASC 855,  Subsequent Events , and determined that no accrual was required as of June 30, 2018.        Because it was determined the assets of FHV LLC are currently insufficient to satisfy FHV LLC s obligations to creditors, as of September 28, 2018, FHV LLC has executed an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors under California law, whereby all of the assets of FHV LLC have been assigned to a third party fiduciary who will expeditiously liquidate such assets and distribute the proceeds thereof to FHV LLC s creditors pursuant to the priorities established and permitted by law.
