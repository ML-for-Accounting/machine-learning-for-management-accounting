LiqTech PTE Ltd ( LiqTech Sing ), a 95% owned subsidiary of LiqTech Int. DK, incorporated in Singapore on January 19, 2012, engaged in marketing and sale of liquid filters in Singapore and other countries in the area. The Company is in the process of closing operations, which is expected to be completed during 2018. 

Consolidation --  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company. The non-controlling interests in the net assets of the subsidiaries are recorded in equity. The non-controlling interests of the results of operations of the subsidiaries are included in the results of operations and recorded as the non-controlling interest in subsidiaries. All material inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated in the consolidation. 

Functional Currency / Foreign currency translation --  The functional currency of LiqTech International, Inc., LiqTech USA, Inc. and LiqTech NA is the U.S. Dollar. The Functional Currency of LiqTech Int. DK and LiqTech Systems AS is the Danish Krone ( DKK ), the functional currency of LiqTech Germany is the Euro and the functional currency of LiqTech Singapore is the Singapore Dollar. The Company s reporting currency is U.S. Dollar for the purpose of these consolidated financial statements. The foreign subsidiaries balance sheet accounts are translated into U.S. Dollars at the period-end exchange rates and all revenue and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rates prevailing during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. Translation gains and losses are deferred and accumulated as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders  equity. Transaction gains and losses that arose from exchange rate fluctuations from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the statement of operations as incurred. 

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash --  The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Table of Contents 

Accounts Receivable --  Accounts receivables consist of trade receivables arising in the normal course of business. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects the Company s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.  

The roll forward of the allowance for doubtful accounts for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017 is as follows: 

Inventory --  Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market, as determined on the first-in, first-out method. 

Property and Equipment --  Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized, upon being placed in service. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to ten years (See Note 4). 

Long-Term Investments --  Investments in non-consolidated companies are included in long-term investments in the consolidated balance sheet and are accounted for under the cost method and equity method. For these non-quoted investments, we regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts based on information requested from these privately held companies. Generally, this information may be more limited, may not be as timely as and may be less accurate than information available from publicly traded companies. Assessing each investment s carrying value requires significant judgment by management. If it is determined that there is an-other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of a non-public equity security, we write-down the investment to its fair value and record the related write-down as an investment loss in the consolidated statement of operations. 

Intangible Assets --  Definite life intangible assets include patents. The Company accounts for definite life intangible assets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification, ( ASC ) Topic 350,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  and amortized the patents on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of two to ten years.  

Revenue Recognition and Sales Incentives   

Revenue Recognition -- Adoption of the new revenue standard:  On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  which includes clarifying ASUs issued in 2015, 2016 and 2017 ( new revenue standard ). The new revenue standard was applied to all open revenue contracts using the modified-retrospective method as of January 1, 2018. The new revenue standard did not have a material impact on revenue recognition. The Company does not expect the impact of the adoption of the new standard to be material to net income on an ongoing basis. 

Accounting policy : Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied which occurs when control of the system, membrane, DPF or services are transferred to the customer. The majority of the Company s sales contracts contain performance obligations satisfied at a point in time when title and risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer. This generally occurs when the product is shipped or accepted by the customer.  Revenue for service contracts are recognized as the services are provided. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring the goods or providing services. The satisfaction of performance obligations under the terms of a revenue contract generally gives rise for the right to payment from the customer. The Company s standard payment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. Generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. Pre-Payments received prior to satisfaction of performance obligations are recorded as a customer deposit liability. Given the insignificant days between revenue recognition and receipt of payment, financing components do not exist between the Company and its customers. In Denmark, Value Added Tax ( VAT ) of 25% of the invoice amount is collected in respect of the sales of goods on behalf of tax authorities. The VAT collected is not revenue of the Company; instead, the amount is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet until such VAT is paid to the authorities.   The estimated costs of product warranties are recognized as expense when the products are sold. See Note 9 for further information on product warranties.

Table of Contents 

For contracts with customers that include multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these contracts are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes. For such arrangements, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus margin. Impairment losses recognized on receivables or contract assets were not significant for the six months ended June 30, 2018. 

The customer generally arranges and pays for shipping activities.  When the Company does arrange for shipping it is billed to the Customer. The Cost to prepare the product for shipment handling are paid by the Company and reported on the line  Cost of goods sold  in the unaudited consolidated statements of operations. 

System sales are recognized when the Company transfers control based upon signed acceptance of the system by the customer, upon shipment or upon final installation of the system based on the terms of the contract. For the majority of Liquid Membrane Filters and Diesel Particulate Filters, the Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when products are shipped to the customer according to the terms of the contract or purchase order. Aftermarket sales represent part sales, extended warranty and maintenance services. For the sale of aftermarket parts, the Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when parts are shipped to the customer or services are provided. When customers are given the right to return eligible parts and accessories, the Company estimates the expected returns based on an analysis of historical experience. The Company adjusts estimated revenues at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration expected to be received changes or when the consideration becomes fixed. The Company recognizes revenue for extended warranty and maintenance agreements based on the standalone selling price over the life of the contract, which reflects the costs to perform under these contracts, which corresponds with, and thereby depicts the transfer of control to the customer. 

The Company has received long-term contracts for grants from government entities for development and use of silicon carbide membranes in various water filtration and treatment applications and historically in the installation of various water filtrations systems. We measure transfer of control of the performance obligation on long-term contracts utilizing the cost-to-cost measure of progress, with cost of revenue including direct costs, such as labor and materials. Under the cost-to-cost approach, the use of estimated costs to complete each performance obligation is a significant variable in the process of determining recognized revenue and a significant factor in the accounting for such performance obligations. The timing of when we bill our customers is generally dependent upon advance billings terms, milestone billings based on completion of certain phases of the work or when services are provided or products are shipped. Projects with performance obligations recognized over time that have costs and estimated earnings recognized to date in excess of cumulative billings are reported on our Balance Sheets as contract assets. Projects with performance obligations recognized over time that have cumulative billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings recognized to date are reported on our Balance Sheets as contract liabilities.    

The two tables below set forth the costs incurred and earnings accrued on uncompleted contracts compared with the billings on those contracts through June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 and reconcile the net excess billings to the amounts included in the balance sheets at those dates. 

The Company s disaggregated revenue is reported in Note 13. 

Advertising Cost --  Costs incurred in connection with advertising of the Company s products is expensed as incurred. Such costs amounted to $3,326 and $4,197 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Research and Development Cost --  The Company expenses research and development costs for the development of new products as incurred. Included in operating expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were $345,677 and $253,346, respectively, of research and development costs.

Table of Contents 

Income Taxes --  The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 Accounting for Income Taxes. This statement requires an asset and liability approach for accounting for income taxes. 

Income (Loss) Per Share --  The Company calculates earnings (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per common share (EPS) are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per common share are based on shares outstanding (computed as under basic EPS) and potentially dilutive common shares. Potential common shares included in the diluted earnings per share calculation include in-the-money stock options and warrants that have been granted but have not been exercised. 

Stock Options and Awards --  The Company has granted stock options to certain key employees during the years presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements (see note 11). The Company accounts for options in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation. Non-cash compensation costs of $87,434 and $125,958 have been recognized for the vesting of options and stock awards granted to employees with an associated recognized tax benefit of $24,367 and $24,650 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments --  The Company accounts for fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820. The authoritative guidance that, among other things, defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the exit price, representing the amount that would either be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 

Level 2. Inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 

Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

Unless otherwise disclosed, the fair value of the Company s financial instruments including cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, investments, accounts payable, accrued expenses, capital lease obligations and notes payable approximates their recorded values due to their short-term maturities. 

Accounting Estimates --  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets including accounts receivable, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost in excess of billings, reserve for obsolete inventory, depreciation and impairment of property plant and equipment, and goodwill; liabilities including billings in excess of costs and contingencies; the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimated. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  -- On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases,  which makes many changes to accounting for leases. The standard will be effective for public companies with interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. One of the most notable changes is many of the leases that are currently accounted for as operating leases will have to be capitalized and accounted for similarly to how capital leases are currently accounted for, unless certain criteria are met. We have begun evaluating the impact this standard will have on our lease accounting. The standard will require us to capitalize a right-of use asset and lease liability equal to the present value of the future minimum lease payments disclosed in Note 8. We will continue to evaluate the impact of this standard as the effective date approaches.    

Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s present or future financial statements.  

NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN  

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has limited cash and has recently incurred significant losses. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising additional cash through the issuance of debt or equity instruments or return to profitable operations in the future. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

Management believes the Company is progressing toward alleviating this substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. During April of 2018, the Company raised $6.6 million through the sale of 19,448,529 common shares, and the Company has signed framework agreements and a letter of intent with a total of three large marine scrubber manufacturers for the potential future sale of a significant number of filtration systems in late 2018 and 2019.

NOTE 9 - AGREEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS  

401(K) Profit Sharing Plan  -- LiqTech NA has a 401(k) profit sharing plan and trust covering certain eligible employees. The amount LiqTech NA contributes is discretionary. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, matching contributions were expensed and totaled $5,706 and $6,004, respectively. 

Contingencies  -- From time to time, we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. 

On September 9, 2014, Mr. Raffaele Bruno Tronchetti Provera ( Plaintiff ), the 60% owner of LiqTech Italy s.r.l. (the  Venture ), sued LiqTech Int. DK, the 40% owner of the Venture ( Defendant ), for damages of  750,000 before the Court of Como, Italy, alleging, among other things, that certain products provided by Defendant to the Venture were defective.  

On July 31, 2018, the Judge rejected the Plaintiff s claim and his request of compensation of   750,000, ordering the claimant to pay the Company s legal expenses. 

On December 20, 2017, the Company received a demand for approximately $1,098,678 from the previous installation of a water treatment system. The customer is disputing that the system complies with the contact based on testing inputs to the system outside the parameters of the contract. The Company has completed the installation of the system, tested the system, and contends it is compliance with the contract s requirements.  The Company currently plans to vigorously pursue collection of the remaining balance owed on the contract, through legal action if required. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome of these uncertainties. No legal action has been initiated to date by either party. 

In connection with certain orders, the Company may provide  a working guarantee,  prepayment guarantee, or security bond. For that purpose, we have a guarantee credit line of DKK 94,620 (approximately $14,801 at June 30, 2018) with a bank, subject to certain base limitations.

Product Warranties  - The Company provides a standard warranty on its systems, generally for one to three years. The Company estimates the costs which may be incurred under its standard warranty programs and records a liability for such costs at the time product revenue is recognized. 

In addition, the Company sells an extended warranty for certain systems, which generally provide a warranty for up to four years from the date of commissioning. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which the Company does business. Revenue received for the sale of extended warranty contracts is deferred and recognized in the same manner as the costs incurred to perform under the warranty contracts. 

The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary. Factors that affect the warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the cost per claim. 

Changes in the Company s current and long-term warranty obligations, including deferred revenue on extended warranty contracts included in accrued expenses on the balance sheet, are as follows:

ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report. In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 23, 2018, and the financial statements and notes thereto. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.  

Overview  

We are a clean technology company that provides state-of-the-art technologies for gas and liquid purification by manufacturing ceramic silicon carbide filters. For more than a decade, we have developed and manufactured products of re-crystallized silicon carbide. We specialize in two business areas: ceramic membranes for liquid filtration and diesel particulate filters ( DPFs  ) for the control of soot exhaust particles from diesel engines. Using nanotechnology, we develop proprietary products using patented silicon carbide technology. Our products are based on unique silicon carbide membranes which facilitate new applications and improve existing technologies. We market our products from our offices in the United States and Denmark, and through local representatives. The products are shipped directly to customers from our production facilities in the United States and Denmark. 

The terms  LiqTech ,  we ,  our ,  us , the  Company  or any derivative thereof, as used herein refer to LiqTech International, Inc., a Nevada corporation ( Parent ), together with its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. The subsidiaries include LiqTech USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( LiqTech USA ), which owns all of the outstanding equity interest in LiqTech International A/S, a Danish limited company, organized under the Danish Act on Limited Companies of the Kingdom of Denmark ( LiqTech Int.

Going Concern   

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has limited cash and recently incurred significant losses. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising additional cash through the issuance of debt or equity instruments or return to profitable operations in the future. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.  

Management believes the Company is progressing toward alleviating this substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. During April of 2018, the Company raised $6.6 million through the sale of 19,448,529 common shares, and the Company has signed framework agreements and a letter of intent with a total of three large marine scrubber manufacturers for the potential future sale of a significant number of filtration systems in late 2018 and 2019. 

Our Strategy  

Our strategy is to create stockholder value by leveraging our competitive strengths and focusing on the opportunities in the end markets we serve. Key features of our strategy include: 

Retain and grow business with new Marine customers , including scrubber technology providers and ship-owners/operators.   

Enter New Geographic Markets and Expand Existing Markets . We plan to continue to manufacture and sell our products out of Denmark and the United States, with organization development in those locations to support our growth strategy We intend to work with agents and partners to access appropriate markets. 

Continue to Strengthen Position in DPF Market.  We believe that we have a strong position in the retrofit market for DPFs. We intend to continue our efforts to maintain our strength in this area. Furthermore, we intend to leverage our experience in the OEM market and expand our presence in this market with new products relating to diesel particulate filter systems.

Table of Contents 

Continue to Develop and Improve Technologies and Open New End Markets.  We intend to continuously develop our ceramic membranes and improve the efficiency of our filtration products. Through continuous development, we intend to identify new uses for our products and plan to expand into any new markets that we believe would be appropriate for our Company. One of our key strategies is to develop our membrane applications together with our customers including, for example, the development of the next generation of diesel particulate filters with asymmetric design for the OEM market. 

Continue Our Focus on Selling and on Development of New Standard Units.  We will continue our focus on selling systems based on our unique SIC Filters. We will also combine the ceramic membranes with other technologies to be able to offer our customers a complete solution. We will continue our focus to develop smaller standard systems, like our groundwater treatment unit and our residential swimming pool units. These units will be sold through a network of agents and partnerships.

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

We have historically satisfied our capital and liquidity requirements through offerings of equity instruments and our available lines of credit. At June 30, 2018, the Company did not have any available lines of credit with any lender. At June 30, 2018, we had a cash balance of $4,491,500 and working capital of $8,613,633 and at December 31, 2017, we had cash balance of $2,486,199 and working capital of $4,659,876. At June 30, 2018, our working capital increased by $3,953,756 compared to December 31, 2017 due to a registered public offering of common stock in the second quarter of 2018. Total current assets were $12,132,102 and $9,427,697 at June 30, 2018 and at December 31, 2017, respectively, and total current liabilities were $3,518,469 and $4,767,821 at June 30, 2018 and at December 31, 2017, respectively.  

In connection with certain orders, we may provide customers a working guarantee, prepayment guarantee, or security bond. For that purpose, we have a guarantee credit line of DKK 94,620 (approximately $14,801 at June 30, 2018) with a bank, subject to certain base limitations. As of June 30, 2018, we had DKK 94,620 (approximately $14,801) in working guarantee against the line. This line of credit is guaranteed by V kstfonden (the Danish state s investments fund) and is secured by certain assets of LiqTech Systems such as receivables, inventory and equipment. 

On April 12, 2018, we issued 19,448,529 shares of common stock in a public offering for gross proceeds of approximately $6.6 million, which has improved our liquidity. We may need additional funds to sustain and grow our business, and we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private sales of equity or debt securities. Financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Additional equity financing may be dilutive to holders of our common stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate our business. 

Cash Flows   

Six months ended June 30, 2018 Compared to three months ended June 30, 2017   

Cash provided (used) by operating activities is net income (losses) adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Cash used by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $3,331,347, representing an increase of $1,501,588 compared to cash used by operating activities of $1,829,759 for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The $1,501,588 increase in cash used by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was mainly due to a decrease of $1,131,833 in accrued expenses, a decrease of $682,820 in long-term contracts, a decrease of $250,828 in accounts payable, and an increase of $78,882 in prepaid expenses/deposits. This was partially offset by a decrease in inventory of $166,621 and a decrease in accounts receivable of $2,562. 

The decrease in accounts receivable, the decrease in accrued expenses, the decrease in accounts payable, the decrease in inventory, the increase in prepaid expenses/deposits and the increase in long-term contracts were all due to normal variations in the ordinary course of business. 

Cash used in investing activities was $82,992 for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to cash used in investing activities of $60,330 for the six months ended June 30, 2017. Cash used in investing activities increased by $22,662 for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017. This increase was due to $12,313 in the purchase of property for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and the sale of property and equipment of $10,349 for the six months ended June 30, 2017. 

Cash provided by financing activities was $5,850,367 for the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $1,711,840 for the six months ended June 30, 2017. This increase of $4,138,527 in cash provided by financing activities was mainly due to a public offering that raised $6,612,500 less offering costs of $747,423 during the six months ended June 30, 2018. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As of June 30, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements other than normal operating leases. We are not aware of any material transactions that are not disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.  

Operating Leases  -- The Company leases office and production facilities under operating lease agreements expiring in August 2018 and March 2021. In some of these lease agreements, the Company has the right to extend.

Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates  

The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: 

the assessment of collectability of accounts receivable, which impacts operating expenses when and if we record bad debt or adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts; 

the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when and if we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation; 

the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; 

the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and 

the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment, 

Recently Enacted Accounting Standards  

For a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see  Note 1: Recently Enacted Accounting Standards  in the accompanying Financial Statements. 

Subsequent Events  

The Company s management reviewed material events through August 14, 2018. 

On July 2, 2018, Aldo Petersen resigned as a director and Chairman of the Board, and the Board of Directors appointed Mark Vernon as Chairman of the Board. 

On July 23, 2018, the Company terminated its independent registered public accounting firm, Gregory   Associates, LLC and retained the services of Sadler, Gibb   Associates, L.L.C. as its independent registered public accounting firm. The Company s audit committee terminated Gregory after being informed that the principal of Gregory formerly responsible for the Company s account will join Sadler, and Gregory will no longer provide audit and assurances services to public companies subject to the statutes and regulations of the United States. 

On July 30, 2018, Soren Degn notified the Company of his retirement as Chief Financial Officer, effective as of August 14, 2018. Mr. Degn will be succeeded by Claus Toftegaard, effective as of August 15, 2018. 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

Not applicable.  

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our Management, with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses identified as part of our 2017 audit. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the registrant s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. For more information on material weaknesses identified by Management, please reference our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management s Remediation Initiatives   

Management has been actively developing a remediation plan and implementing new controls and processes to address the aforementioned deficiencies. Upon identifying the material weakness in of our internal controls, we have taken actions to strengthen our internal control structure. 

Management continues to meet with key managers and control owners to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls and to ensure implementation of remediation initiatives. 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls   

An internal control system, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by Management override of the internal control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
