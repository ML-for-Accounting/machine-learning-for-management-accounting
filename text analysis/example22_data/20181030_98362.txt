Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Replacement Award may take the form of a continuation of the Option if the requirements of the preceding sentence are satisfied. The determination of whether the conditions of this Section 2(b)(ii) are satisfied will be made by the Committee, as constituted immediately before the Change in Control, in its sole discretion. 
  (iii)  For purposes of Section 2(b)(ii),  Good Reason  will be defined to mean: a material reduction in the nature or scope of the responsibilities, authorities or duties of the Optionee attached to the Optionee s position held immediately prior to the Change in Control, a change of more than 60 miles in the location of the Optionee s principal office immediately prior to the Change in Control, or a material reduction in the Optionee s remuneration upon or after the Change in Control;   provided  , that no later than 90 days following an event constituting Good Reason, the Optionee gives notice to the Company or the Successor of the occurrence of such event and the Company or the Successor fails to cure the event within 30 days following the receipt of such notice.

For purposes of this Agreement,  Cause  shall mean: an intentional act of fraud, embezzlement or theft in connection with the Optionee s duties with the Company or a Subsidiary (or the Successor, if applicable); (ii) an intentional wrongful disclosure of secret processes or confidential information of the Company or a Subsidiary (or the Successor, if applicable); (iii) an intentional, wrongful engagement in any competitive activity that would constitute a material breach of the Optionee s duty of loyalty to the Company or a Subsidiary (or the Successor, if applicable); (iv) the willful misconduct in the performance of the Optionee s duties to the Company or a Subsidiary (or the Successor, if applicable); or (v) gross negligence in the performance of the Optionee s duties to the Company or a Subsidiary (or the Successor, if applicable).

  3.        Termination of Option  .  The Option shall terminate automatically and without further notice on the earliest of the following dates:  
  (a)  ninety days after the date upon which the Optionee ceases to be an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary, unless (i) the cessation of his employment (A) is a result of his death, permanent disability, or retirement or (B) follows a Change in Control, a divestiture, or a Termination Without Cause, or (ii) the Optionee continues to serve as a director of the Company following the cessation of his employment;

   3 

4.  Payment of Option Price  .  The Option Price shall be payable (a) in cash in the form of currency or check or other cash equivalent acceptable to the Company, (b) by transfer to the Company of nonforfeitable, unrestricted Common Shares that have been owned by the Optionee for at least six months prior to the date of exercise, (c) subject to any conditions or limitations established by the Committee, the Company s withholding Common Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of the Option pursuant to a  net exercise  arrangement, or (d) by any combination of the methods of payment described in Sections 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c) hereof.  Nonforfeitable, unrestricted Common Shares that are transferred by the Optionee in payment of all or any part of the Option Price and Common Shares withheld by the Company shall be valued on the basis of their Market Value per Share.  Subject to the terms and conditions of Section 7 hereof and Section 12 of the Plan, and subject to any deferral election the Optionee may have made pursuant to any plan or program of the Company, the Company shall cause certificates for any shares purchased hereunder to be delivered to the Optionee upon payment of the Option Price in full. 
  5.  Compliance with Law  .  The Company shall make reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws;   provided  ,   however  , notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Option shall not be exercisable if the exercise thereof would result in a violation of any such law.  To the extent that the Ohio Securities Act shall be applicable to the Option, the Option shall not be exercisable unless the Common Shares or other securities covered by the Option are (a) exempt from registration thereunder, (b) the subject of a transaction that is exempt from compliance therewith, (c) registered by description or qualification thereunder or (d) the subject of a transaction that shall have been registered by description thereunder.  
  6.  Transferability and Exercisability  .    
  (a)  Except as provided in Section 6(b) below, the Option, including any interest therein, shall not be transferable by the Optionee except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and the Option shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the Optionee only by him or, in the event of his legal incapacity to do so, by his guardian or legal representative acting on behalf of the Optionee in a fiduciary capacity under state law and court supervision. 
  (b)  Notwithstanding Section 6(a) above, the Option may be transferable by the Optionee, without payment of consideration therefor, to any family member of the Optionee (as defined in Form S-8), or to one or more trusts established solely for the benefit of such members of the immediate family or to partnerships in which the only partners are such members of the immediate family of the Optionee;   provided  ,   however  , that such transfer will not be effective until notice of such transfer is delivered to the Company; and   provided  ,   further  ,   however  , that any such transferee is subject to the same terms and conditions hereunder as the Optionee.  
  7.  Adjustments  .  Subject to Section 12 of the Plan, the Committee shall make any adjustments in the Option Price and the number or kind of shares of stock or other securities covered by the Option, and in other terms and provisions, that the Committee shall determine to be equitably required to prevent any dilution or expansion of the Optionee s rights under this Agreement that otherwise would result from any (a) stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the Company, (b) merger, consolidation, separation, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other distribution of assets involving the Company or (c) other transaction or event having an effect similar to any of those referred to in Section 7(a) or 7(b) hereof.  Furthermore, in the event that any transaction or event described or referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, or a Change in Control, shall occur, the Committee shall provide in substitution of any or all of the Optionee s rights under this Agreement such alternative consideration (including cash) as the Committee shall determine in good faith to be equitable under the circumstances.  
  8.  Withholding Taxes  .  To the extent that the Company is required to withhold federal, state, local or foreign taxes in connection with any delivery of Common Shares to the Optionee, and the amounts available to the Company for such withholding are insufficient, it shall be a condition to the receipt of such  
  
   4 

delivery that the Optionee make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for payment of the balance of such taxes required to be withheld.   The Optionee may elect that all or any part of such withholding requirement be satisfied by retention by the Company of a portion of the Common Shares delivered to the Optionee.  Any Common Shares so withheld shall be credited against such withholding requirements at the market value of such shares on the date of such withholding. 
  9.  Detrimental Activity and Recapture  .  
  (a)  In the event that, as determined by the Committee, the Optionee shall engage in Detrimental Activity during employment with the Company or a Subsidiary, the Option will be forfeited automatically and without further notice at the time of that determination notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement.  Nothing in this Agreement prevents the Optionee from providing, without prior notice to the Company, information to governmental authorities regarding possible legal violations or otherwise testifying or participating in any investigation or proceeding by any governmental authorities regarding possible legal violations. 
  (b)  If a Restatement occurs and the Committee determines that the Optionee is personally responsible for causing the Restatement as a result of the Optionee s personal misconduct or any fraudulent activity on the part of the Optionee, then the Committee has discretion to, based on applicable facts and circumstances and subject to applicable law, cause the Company to recover all or any portion (but no more than 100%) of the Option (and the Common Shares underlying the Option) awarded to the Optionee for some or all of the years covered by the Restatement. The amount of the Option (and the Common Shares underlying the Option) recovered by the Company shall be limited to the amount by which such Option (and the Common Shares underlying the Option) exceeded the amount that would have been awarded to the Optionee had the Company s financial statements for the applicable restated fiscal year or years been initially filed as restated, as reasonably determined by the Committee. The Committee shall also determine whether the Company shall effect any recovery under this Section 9(b) by: (i) seeking repayment from the Optionee; (ii) reducing, except with respect to any non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, the amount that would otherwise be payable to the Optionee under any compensatory plan, program or arrangement maintained by the Company (subject to applicable law and the terms and conditions of such plan, program or arrangement); (iii) by withholding, except with respect to any non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, payment of future increases in compensation (including the payment of any discretionary bonus amount) that would otherwise have been made to the Optionee in accordance with the Company s compensation practices; or (iv) by any combination of these alternatives.  For purposes of this Agreement,  Restatement  means a restatement of any part of the Company s financial statements for any fiscal year or years beginning with the year in which the Date of Grant occurs due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the U.S. securities laws applicable to such fiscal year or years.  
  10.  Clawback  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the Optionee breaches any of the Optionee s obligations under any non-competition or other restrictive covenant agreement that the Optionee has entered into with the Company or a Subsidiary, including the Nondisclosure and Assignment Agreement attached hereto as   Exhibit A   (the  Non-Competition Agreement ), to the extent permissible by local law, the Optionee shall forfeit any portion of the Option that has not become exercisable and any portion of the Option that has become exercisable, but has not yet been exercised.  In addition, in the event that the Optionee breaches the Non-Competition Agreement, if the Company shall so determine, the Optionee shall, promptly upon notice of such determination, (a) return to the Company all of the Common Shares that the Optionee has not disposed of that were issued upon exercise of any portion of the Option that became exercisable pursuant to this Agreement, and (b) with respect to any Common Shares so issued upon exercise under this Agreement that the Optionee has disposed of, pay to the Company in cash the difference between the Option Price and the aggregate Market Value per Share of those Common Shares on the date of exercise, in each case as reasonably determined by the Company.  To the extent that such amounts are not promptly paid to the Company, the Company may set off the amounts so payable to it against any amounts (other than amounts of non-qualified deferred compensation as so defined under Section 409A of the Code) that may be owing  
  
   5 

from time to time by the Company or a Subsidiary to the Optionee, whether as wages or vacation pay or in the form of any other benefit or for any other reason.  
  11.  No Right to Future Awards or Continued Employment  .  This Option is a voluntary, discretionary bonus being made on a one-time basis and it does not constitute a commitment to make any future awards.  This Option and any payments made hereunder will not be considered salary or other compensation for purposes of any severance pay or similar allowance, except as otherwise required by law.  Nothing in this Agreement will give the Optionee any right to continue employment with the Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may be, or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or a Subsidiary to terminate the employment of the Optionee.  
  12.  Relation to Other Benefits  .  Any economic or other benefit to the Optionee under this Agreement or the Plan shall not be taken into account in determining any benefits to which the Optionee may be entitled under any profit-sharing, retirement or other benefit or compensation plan maintained by the Company or a Subsidiary and shall not affect the amount of any life insurance coverage available to any beneficiary under any life insurance plan covering employees of the Company or a Subsidiary.  
  13.  Amendments  .  Any amendment to the Plan shall be deemed to be an amendment to this Agreement to the extent that the amendment is applicable hereto; provided, however, that no amendment shall adversely affect the rights of the Optionee with respect to the Option without the Optionee s consent.  
  14.  Severability  .  If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any provision hereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision in any other person or circumstances shall not be affected, and the provisions so held to be invalid or unenforceable shall be reformed to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary to make it enforceable and valid.  
  15.  Processing of Information  .  Information about the Optionee and the Optionee s participation in the Plan may be collected, recorded and held, used and disclosed for any purpose related to the administration of the Plan.  The Optionee understands that such processing of this information may need to be carried out by the Company and its Subsidiaries and by third party administrators whether such persons are located within the Optionee s country or elsewhere, including the United States of America.  The Optionee consents to the processing of information relating to the Optionee and the Optionee s participation in the Plan in any one or more of the ways referred to above.    
  16.  Governing Law  .  This Agreement is made under, and shall be construed in accordance with, the internal substantive laws of the State of Ohio.           
  17.  Relation to Plan  .  Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Plan.

No act, or failure to act, on the part of the Optionee shall be deemed  intentional  unless done or omitted to be done by the Optionee not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the Optionee s action or omission was in or not opposed to the best interest of the Company or a Subsidiary (or the Successor, if applicable);   provided  , that for any Optionee who is party to an individual severance or employment agreement defining Cause,  Cause  will have the meaning set forth in such agreement.  
  (e)  Release Requirement  :  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent permitted under applicable law, the Option will not become exercisable pursuant to Section 2(d) of this Agreement as a result of a Termination Without Cause or pursuant to Section 2(b)(ii)(E) of this Agreement as a result of a termination of employment for Good Reason by Optionee or without Cause by the Successor unless, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Optionee signs, does not revoke, and agrees to be bound by a general release of claims in a form provided by the Company which release must be signed, and any applicable revocation period shall have expired within 30 or 60 days (as specified by the Company at the time such release is provided) of Optionee s termination of employment.  
  3.        Termination of Option  .  The Option shall terminate automatically and without further notice on the earliest of the following dates:  
  (a)  ninety days after the date upon which the Optionee ceases to be an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary, unless (i) the cessation of his employment (A) is a result of his death, permanent disability, or retirement or (B) follows a Change in Control, a divestiture, or a Termination Without Cause, or (ii) the Optionee continues to serve as a director of the Company following the cessation of his employment; 
  (b)  three years after the date upon which the Optionee ceases to be  an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary following (i) a Change in Control, (ii) a divestiture, or (iii) a Termination Without Cause;   
  (c)  five years after the date upon which the Optionee ceases to be an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary (i) as a result of his death, or (ii) as a result of his permanent disability;  
  (d)  five years after the date upon which the Optionee ceases to be a director of the Company if he continues to serve as a director of the Company following the cessation of his employment other than as a result of his retirement; or  
  (e)  ten years after the Date of Grant.  (By way of illustration, if (i) the Optionee remains an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary until the ten-year anniversary of the Date of Grant, or (ii) the Optionee ceases to be an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary as a result of his retirement, the Option shall terminate automatically and without further notice ten years after the Date of Grant.)  
           In the event that the Optionee shall intentionally commit an act that the Committee determines to be materially adverse to the interests of the Company or a Subsidiary, the Option shall terminate at the time of that determination notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary.   
  
   3 

4.  Payment of Option Price  .  The Option Price shall be payable (a) in cash in the form of currency or check or other cash equivalent acceptable to the Company, (b) by transfer to the Company of nonforfeitable, unrestricted Common Shares that have been owned by the Optionee for at least six months prior to the date of exercise, (c) subject to any conditions or limitations established by the Committee, the Company s withholding Common Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of the Option pursuant to a  net exercise  arrangement, or (d) by any combination of the methods of payment described in Sections 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c) hereof.  Nonforfeitable, unrestricted Common Shares that are transferred by the Optionee in payment of all or any part of the Option Price and Common Shares withheld by the Company shall be valued on the basis of their Market Value per Share.  Subject to the terms and conditions of Section 7 hereof and Section 12 of the Plan, and subject to any deferral election the Optionee may have made pursuant to any plan or program of the Company, the Company shall cause certificates for any shares purchased hereunder to be delivered to the Optionee upon payment of the Option Price in full. 
  5.  Compliance with Law  .  The Company shall make reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws;   provided  ,   however  , notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Option shall not be exercisable if the exercise thereof would result in a violation of any such law.  To the extent that the Ohio Securities Act shall be applicable to the Option, the Option shall not be exercisable unless the Common Shares or other securities covered by the Option are (a) exempt from registration thereunder, (b) the subject of a transaction that is exempt from compliance therewith, (c) registered by description or qualification thereunder or (d) the subject of a transaction that shall have been registered by description thereunder.  
  6.  Transferability and Exercisability  .  The Option, including any interest therein, shall not be transferable by the Optionee except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and the Option shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the Optionee only by him or, in the event of his legal incapacity to do so, by his guardian or legal representative acting on behalf of the Optionee in a fiduciary capacity under state law and court supervision. 
  7.  Adjustments  .  Subject to Section 12 of the Plan, the Committee shall make any adjustments in the Option Price and the number or kind of shares of stock or other securities covered by the Option, and in other terms and provisions, that the Committee shall determine to be equitably required to prevent any dilution or expansion of the Optionee s rights under this Agreement that otherwise would result from any (a) stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the Company, (b) merger, consolidation, separation, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other distribution of assets involving the Company or (c) other transaction or event having an effect similar to any of those referred to in Section 7(a) or 7(b) hereof.  Furthermore, in the event that any transaction or event described or referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, or a Change in Control, shall occur, the Committee shall provide in substitution of any or all of the Optionee s rights under this Agreement such alternative consideration (including cash) as the Committee shall determine in good faith to be equitable under the circumstances.  
  8.  Withholding Taxes  .  To the extent that the Company or a Subsidiary is required to withhold federal, state, local or foreign taxes in connection with any delivery of Common Shares to the Optionee, and the amounts available to the Company for such withholding are insufficient, it shall be a condition to the receipt of such delivery that the Optionee make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for payment of the balance of such taxes required to be withheld.   To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Optionee may elect that all or any part of such withholding requirement be satisfied by retention by the Company of a portion of the Common Shares delivered to the Optionee or by the Optionee s surrender of a portion of the Common Shares that he or she has owned.  Any Common Shares so withheld shall be credited against such withholding requirements at the market value of such shares on the date of such withholding.  The Optionee may also satisfy such tax obligation by paying the Company cash via personal check or having such amounts deducted from payroll, to the extent permitted by applicable law.   
  
   4 

9.  Detrimental Activity and Recapture  .  
  (a)  To the extent permitted by applicable law, in the event that, as determined by the Committee, the Optionee shall engage in Detrimental Activity during employment with the Company or a Subsidiary, the Option will be forfeited automatically and without further notice at the time of that determination notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement.  Nothing in this Agreement prevents the Optionee from providing, without prior notice to the Company, information to governmental authorities regarding possible legal violations or otherwise testifying or participating in any investigation or proceeding by any governmental authorities regarding possible legal violations. 
  (b)  To the extent permitted by applicable law, if a Restatement occurs and the Committee determines that the Optionee is personally responsible for causing the Restatement as a result of the Optionee s personal misconduct or any fraudulent activity on the part of the Optionee, then the Committee has discretion to, based on applicable facts and circumstances and subject to applicable law, cause the Company to recover all or any portion (but no more than 100%) of the Option (and the Common Shares underlying the Option) awarded to the Optionee for some or all of the years covered by the Restatement. The amount of the Option (and the Common Shares underlying the Option) recovered by the Company shall be limited to the amount by which such Option (and the Common Shares underlying the Option) exceeded the amount that would have been awarded to the Optionee had the Company s financial statements for the applicable restated fiscal year or years been initially filed as restated, as reasonably determined by the Committee. The Committee shall also determine whether the Company shall effect any recovery under this Section 9(b) by: (i) seeking repayment from the Optionee; (ii) reducing, except with respect to any non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code (to the extent applicable), the amount that would otherwise be payable to the Optionee under any compensatory plan, program or arrangement maintained by the Company (subject to applicable law and the terms and conditions of such plan, program or arrangement); (iii) by withholding, except with respect to any non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code (to the extent applicable), payment of future increases in compensation (including the payment of any discretionary bonus amount) that would otherwise have been made to the Optionee in accordance with the Company s compensation practices; or (iv) by any combination of these alternatives.  For purposes of this Agreement,  Restatement  means a restatement of any part of the Company s financial statements for any fiscal year or years beginning with the year in which the Date of Grant occurs due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the U.S. securities laws applicable to such fiscal year or years.  
  10.  Clawback  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the Optionee breaches any of the Optionee s obligations under any non-competition or other restrictive covenant agreement that the Optionee has entered into with the Company or a Subsidiary (the  Non-Competition Agreement ), to the extent permissible by local law, the Optionee shall forfeit any portion of the Option that has not become exercisable and any portion of the Option that has become exercisable, but has not yet been exercised.  In addition, in the event that the Optionee breaches the Non-Competition Agreement, if the Company shall so determine, the Optionee shall, promptly upon notice of such determination, (a) return to the Company all of the Common Shares that the Optionee has not disposed of that were issued upon exercise of any portion of the Option that became exercisable pursuant to this Agreement, and (b) with respect to any Common Shares so issued upon exercise under this Agreement that the Optionee has disposed of, pay to the Company in cash the difference between the Option Price and the aggregate Market Value per Share of those Common Shares on the date of exercise, in each case as reasonably determined by the Company.  To the extent that such amounts are not promptly paid to the Company, the Company may set off the amounts so payable to it against any amounts (other than amounts of non-qualified deferred compensation as so defined under Section 409A of the Code, to the extent applicable) that may be owing from time to time by the Company or a Subsidiary to the Optionee, whether as wages or vacation pay or in the form of any other benefit or for any other reason.  
  11.  No Right to Future Awards or Continued Employment  .  This Option is a voluntary, discretionary bonus being made on a one-time basis and it does not constitute a commitment to make any future awards.  This Option and any payments made hereunder will not be considered salary or other  
  
   5 

compensation for purposes of any severance pay or similar allowance, except as otherwise required by law.  Nothing in this Agreement will give the Optionee any right to continue employment with the Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may be, or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or a Subsidiary to terminate the employment of the Optionee.  
  12.  Relation to Other Benefits  .  Any economic or other benefit to the Optionee under this Agreement or the Plan shall not be taken into account in determining any benefits to which the Optionee may be entitled under any profit-sharing, retirement or other benefit or compensation plan maintained by the Company or a Subsidiary and shall not affect the amount of any life insurance coverage available to any beneficiary under any life insurance plan covering employees of the Company or a Subsidiary.  
  13.  Amendments  .  Any amendment to the Plan shall be deemed to be an amendment to this Agreement to the extent that the amendment is applicable hereto; provided, however, that no amendment shall adversely affect the rights of the Optionee with respect to the Option without the Optionee s consent.  
  14.  Severability  .  If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any provision hereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision in any other person or circumstances shall not be affected, and the provisions so held to be invalid or unenforceable shall be reformed to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary to make it enforceable and valid.  
  15.  Processing of Information  .  Information about the Optionee and the Optionee s participation in the Plan may be collected, recorded and held, used and disclosed for any purpose related to the administration of the Plan.  The Optionee understands that such processing of this information may need to be carried out by the Company and its Subsidiaries and by third party administrators whether such persons are located within the Optionee s country or elsewhere, including the United States of America.  The Optionee consents to the processing of information relating to the Optionee and the Optionee s participation in the Plan in any one or more of the ways referred to above.    
  16.  Language  .  By signing this Agreement, you acknowledge that you have agreed to the receipt of this Agreement and all documents related to the Option in the English language.  
  17.  Governing Law  .  This Agreement is made under, and shall be construed in accordance with, the internal substantive laws of the State of Ohio.           
  18.  Relation to Plan  .  Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Plan.  
  19.  Non-U.S. Addendum  .  Notwithstanding any provisions in this document to the contrary, the Option will also be subject to the special terms and conditions set forth on   Appendix A   for Optionees who reside outside of the United States.  Moreover, if an Optionee is not a resident of any of the countries listed on   Appendix A   as of the Date of Grant, but relocates to one of the listed countries at any point thereafter, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to the Optionee, to the extent the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions are necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan.    Appendix A   constitutes part of this Agreement.

[  TO BE UPDATED TO CONFORM WITH TERMS OF AGREEMENT  ] 
  Appendix A 
  SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE NONQUALIFIED TIMKEN OPTION AGREEMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL TIMKEN PARTICIPANTS  
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
  This   Appendix A  , which is part of the Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement (the    Agreement   ), contains special terms and conditions of the Option that will apply to you if you reside in one of the countries listed below.  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the same meanings assigned to them in The Timken Company s 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated as of February 13, 2015 (the    Plan   ), and/or the Agreement.  
  NOTIFICATIONS  
  This   Appendix A   also includes information regarding exchange control and certain other issues of which you should be aware with respect to your Option.  The information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of January 2018.  Such laws are often complex and change frequently.  The Timken Company (the    Company   ) therefore strongly recommends that you do not rely on the information in this   Appendix A   as the only source of information relating to the consequences of the Option because such information may be outdated when the Option is exercised and/or you sell any common shares of the Company received upon exercise.   
  In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure you of a particular result.  Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your country may apply to your situation.  
  Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, transferred employment after the Option was granted to you, or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the information contained herein may not apply.  
  COUNTRIES COVERED BY THIS   APPENDIX A  :  
  China, France, Germany, India, Poland, Romania, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
  ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL NON-U.S. TIMKEN PARTICIPANTS:  
  1.  Electronic Delivery and Consent to Electronic Participation  .  The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to the Option(s) by electronic means.  The Optionee has consented to receive such documents by electronic delivery and to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or another third party designated by Company.  
  
   8 

2.  Nature of Grant  .  The Optionee has acknowledged that:  
  (a)  the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, unless otherwise provided in the Plan or the Agreement;  
  (b)  the grant of the Option is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Option Rights, or benefits in lieu of Option Rights, even if Option Rights have been granted repeatedly in the past;  
  (c)  all decisions with respect to future grants of Option Rights, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;  
  (d)  the Optionee is voluntarily participating in the Plan;

  (f)  the Option is not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments;   
  (g)  the future value of the underlying Common Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;   
  (h)  in consideration of the grant of the Option, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture or termination of the Option or diminution in value of the Option or the Common Shares resulting from the Optionee s termination of employment (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws); 
    
  (i)  notwithstanding any terms or conditions of the Plan to the contrary, in the event of the involuntary termination of the Optionee s employment, the Optionee s right to receive the Option and vest in the Option under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that the Optionee is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., active employment would not include a period of  garden leave  or similar period pursuant to local law); furthermore, in the event of the involuntary termination of employment, the Optionee s right to vest in the Option after termination of employment, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of the Optionee s active employment and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law.    
  3.  Data Privacy  .    The Optionee hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of the Optionee s personal data as described in this document by and among, as applicable, the Optionee s employer (the  Employer ), the Company and its Subsidiaries and affiliates, for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Optionee s participation in the Plan. 
  The Optionee understands that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about the Optionee, including, but not limited to, the Optionee s name, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number, passport number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all options or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, purchased, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Optionee s favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan ( Data ).

The Optionee understands that the Optionee may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting the Optionee s local human resources representative.  The Optionee authorizes the Company, Computershare and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Optionee s participation in the Plan.  The Optionee understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage the Optionee s participation in the Plan.  The Optionee understands that the Optionee may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing the Optionee s local human resources representative.

              (ii) 
    If a Replacement Award is provided, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any outstanding Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends then accumulated with respect thereto which at the time of the Change in Control are not subject to a  substantial risk of forfeiture  (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) will be deemed to be nonforfeitable at the time of such Change in Control.

    Termination Without Cause  :  Subject to Section 5(c) hereof, if (i) Grantee s employment with the Company or a Subsidiary terminates as the result of a termination by the Company or a Subsidiary other than for Cause (a  Termination Without Cause ) and (ii) Grantee is entitled to receive severance pay pursuant to the terms of any severance pay plan of the Company in effect at the time of Grantee s termination of employment that provides for severance pay calculated by multiplying Grantee s base compensation by a specified severance period, then Grantee s right to receive the Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends then accumulated with respect thereto shall become nonforfeitable in accordance with the terms and conditions of, and over the time period described in, Section 1(a) as if Grantee had remained in the continuous employ of the Company or a Subsidiary from the Date of Grant until the date of the third anniversary of the Date of Grant or the occurrence of a circumstance referenced in Section 2(a) or 2(b), whichever occurs first; provided, however, that if the specified severance period ends before the date of the third anniversary of the Date of Grant, Grantee s right to receive the Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends accumulated with respect thereto shall be forfeited automatically at the end of the severance period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Grantee s employment is Terminated Without Cause after Grantee becomes eligible for retirement at or after age 62, then Section 1(b) shall govern.    
       For purposes of this Agreement,  Cause  shall mean:  (i) an intentional act of fraud, embezzlement or theft in connection with Grantee s duties with the Company or a Subsidiary (or the Successor, if applicable); (ii) an intentional wrongful disclosure of secret processes or confidential information of the Company or a Subsidiary (or the Successor, if applicable); (iii) an intentional  ,   wrongful engagement in any competitive activity that would constitute a material breach of Grantee s duty of loyalty to the Company or a Subsidiary (or the Successor, if applicable); (iv) the willful misconduct in the performance of the Grantee s duties to the Company or a Subsidiary (or the Successor, if applicable); or (v) gross negligence in the performance of Grantee s duties to the company or a Subsidiary (or the Successor, if applicable).  No act, or failure to act, on the part of Grantee shall be deemed  intentional  unless done or omitted to be done by Grantee not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the Grantee s action or omission was in or not opposed to the best interest of the Company or a Subsidiary (or the Successor, if applicable); provided that for any Grantee who is party to an individual severance or employment agreement defining Cause,  Cause  will have the meaning set forth in such agreement.  
           1. 
    Forfeiture of Awards  .  Grantee s right to receive the Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends accumulated with respect thereto shall be forfeited automatically and without further notice on the date that Grantee ceases to be an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary prior to the third anniversary of the Date of Grant for any reason other than as described in Sections 1 or 2 hereof.  In the event that Grantee shall intentionally commit an act that the Committee determines to be materially adverse to the interests of the Company or a Subsidiary, Grantee s right to receive the Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends accumulated with respect thereto shall be forfeited at the time of that determination notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary.    
              2. 
    Crediting of Deferred Cash Dividends  .  With respect to each of the Common Shares covered by this Agreement, Grantee shall be credited on the records of the Company with Deferred Cash Dividends in an amount equal to the amount per share of any cash dividends declared by the Board  
     
   4 

on the outstanding Common Shares during the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the date on which Grantee receives payment of the Common Shares covered by this Agreement pursuant to Section 5 hereof or at the time when the Common Shares covered by this Agreement are forfeited in accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement.

              (b) 
    Other Payment Events  :  Notwithstanding Section 5(a), to the extent that the Common Shares covered by this Agreement are nonforfeitable on the dates set forth below, payment with respect to the Common Shares covered by this Agreement that have become nonforfeitable and any Deferred Cash Dividends accumulated with respect thereto will be made as follows:

    Change in Control  .  Within 10 days of a Change in Control, Grantee is entitled to receive payment for the Common Shares covered by this Agreement that are nonforfeitable and any Deferred Cash Dividends accumulated with respect thereto on the date of the Change in Control;   provided  ,   however  , that if such Change in Control would not qualify as a permissible date of distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(A) of the Code, and the regulations thereunder, and where Section 409A of the Code applies to such distribution, Grantee is entitled to receive the corresponding payment on the date that would have otherwise applied pursuant to Sections 5(a) or 5(b)(ii) as though such Change in Control had not occurred.    
              (ii) 
    Death or Disability  .  Within 10 days of the date of Grantee s death or the date Grantee becomes permanently disabled, Grantee is entitled to receive payment for the Common Shares covered by this Agreement that are nonforfeitable and any Deferred Cash Dividends accumulated with respect thereto on such date.  
              (c) 
    Release Requirement  :  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends accumulated with respect thereto will not become nonforfeitable or payable pursuant to Section 2(d) of this Agreement as a result of a Termination Without Cause or pursuant to Section 2(b)(ii)(E) of this Agreement as a result of a termination of employment for Good Reason by Grantee or without Cause by Successor unless, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Grantee signs, does not revoke, and agrees to be bound by a general release of claims in a form provided by the Company which release must be signed, and any applicable revocation period shall have expired within 30 or 60 days (as specified by the Company at the time such release is provided) of Grantee s termination of employment (such 30 day or 60 day period, as applicable, the  Review Period ).  In the event such Review Period begins in 1 taxable year of the Grantee, and ends in a 2   nd    taxable year of the Grantee, then to the extent necessary to avoid any penalties or additional taxes under Section 409A of the Code, no payment shall be made before the 2   nd    taxable year.   
              4. 
    Compliance with Law  .  The Company shall make reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws;   provided  ,   however  , notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated to issue any of the Common Shares covered by this Agreement or pay any Deferred Cash Dividends accumulated with respect thereto if the issuance or payment thereof would result in violation of any such law.  To the extent that the Ohio Securities Act shall be applicable to this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated to issue  
     
   5 

any of the Common Shares or other securities covered by this Agreement or pay any Deferred Cash  
  Dividends accumulated with respect thereto unless such Common Shares and Deferred Cash Dividends are (a) exempt from registration thereunder, (b) the subject of a transaction  that is exempt from compliance therewith, (c) registered by description or qualification thereunder or (d) the subject of a transaction that shall have been registered by description thereunder.  
           5. 
    Transferability  .  Neither Grantee s right to receive the Common Shares covered by this Agreement nor his right to receive any Deferred Cash Dividends shall be transferable by Grantee except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  Any purported transfer in violation of this Section 7 shall be null and void, and the purported transferee shall obtain no rights with respect to such Shares.  
              6. 
    Compliance with Section 409A of the Code  .  To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Agreement and the Plan comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code.  This Agreement and the Plan shall be administered in a manner consistent with this intent.  
              7. 
    Adjustments  .  Subject to Section 12 of the Plan, the Committee shall make any adjustments in the number or kind of shares of stock or other securities covered by this Agreement, and other terms and provisions, that the Committee shall determine to be equitably required to prevent any dilution or expansion of Grantee s rights under this Agreement that otherwise would result from any (a) stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the Company, (b) merger, consolidation, separation, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other distribution of assets involving the Company or (c) other transaction or event having an effect similar to any of those referred to in subsection (a) or (b) herein.  Furthermore, in the event that any transaction or event described or referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, or a Change in Control, shall occur, the Committee shall provide in substitution of any or all of Grantee s rights under this Agreement such alternative consideration (including cash) as the Committee shall determine in good faith to be equitable under the circumstances.  
              8. 
    Withholding Taxes  .  To the extent that the Company is required to withhold federal, state, local or foreign taxes in connection with any delivery of Common Shares to Grantee, and the amounts available to the Company for such withholding are insufficient, it shall be a condition to the receipt of such delivery that Grantee make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for payment of the balance of such taxes required to be withheld.  Grantee may elect that all or any part of such withholding requirement be satisfied by retention by the Company of a portion of the Common Shares delivered to Grantee. Any Common Shares so withheld shall be credited against such withholding requirements at the market value of such shares on the date of such withholding. 
              9. 
    Detrimental Activity and Recapture  .  
              (a) 
    In the event that, as determined by the Committee, Grantee shall engage in Detrimental Activity during employment with the Company or a Subsidiary, the Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends accumulated with respect thereto will be forfeited automatically and without further notice at the time of that determination notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement.  Nothing in this Agreement prevents Grantee from providing, without prior notice to the Company, information to governmental authorities regarding possible legal violations or otherwise testifying or participating in any investigation or proceeding by any governmental authorities regarding possible legal violations. 
              (b) 
    If a Restatement occurs and the Committee determines that Grantee is personally responsible for causing the Restatement as a result of Grantee s personal misconduct or any fraudulent activity on the part of Grantee, then the Committee has discretion to, based on applicable facts and circumstances and subject to applicable law, cause the Company to  
     
   6 

recover all or any portion (but no more than 100%) of the Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends accumulated with respect thereto earned or payable to Grantee for some or all of the years covered by the Restatement. The amount of any earned or payable Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends accumulated with respect thereto recovered by the Company shall be limited to the amount by which such earned or payable Common Shares and Deferred Cash Dividends exceeded the amount that would have been earned by or paid to Grantee had the Company s financial statements for the applicable restated fiscal year or years been initially filed as restated, as reasonably determined by the Committee. The Committee shall also determine whether the Company shall effect any recovery under this Section 11(b) by: (i) seeking repayment from Grantee; (ii) reducing, except with respect to any non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, the amount that would otherwise be payable to Grantee under any compensatory plan, program or arrangement maintained by the Company (subject to applicable law and the terms and conditions of such plan, program or arrangement); (iii) by withholding, except with respect to any non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, payment of future increases in compensation (including the payment of any discretionary bonus amount) that would otherwise have been made to Grantee in accordance with the Company s compensation practices; or (iv) by any combination of these alternatives.  For purposes of this Agreement,  Restatement  means a restatement of any part of the Company s financial statements for any fiscal year or years beginning with the year in which the Date of Grant occurs due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the U.S. securities laws applicable to such fiscal year or years.  
           10. 
    Clawback  . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if Grantee breaches any of Grantee s obligations under any non-competition or other restrictive covenant agreement that it has entered into with the Company or a Subsidiary, including the Nondisclosure and Assignment Agreement attached hereto as   Exhibit A   (the  Non-Competition Agreement ), to the extent permissible by local law, Grantee shall forfeit any Common Shares and any Deferred Cash Dividends.  In addition, in the event that Grantee breaches the Non-Competition Agreement, if the Company shall so determine, Grantee shall, promptly upon notice of such determination, (a) return to the Company, all the Common Shares that Grantee has received but not disposed of that became nonforfeitable pursuant to this Agreement, (b) with respect to any Common Shares so issued pursuant to this Agreement that Grantee has disposed of, pay to the Company in cash the aggregate Market Value per Share of those Common Shares on the date on which the Common Shares were issued under this Agreement, and (c) return to the Company any cash amount paid with respect to the Deferred Cash Dividends, in each case as reasonably determined by the Company.  To the extent that such amounts are not promptly paid to the Company, the Company may set off the amounts so payable to it against any amounts (other than amounts of non-qualified deferred compensation as so defined under Section 409A of the Code) that may be owing from time to time by the Company or a Subsidiary to Grantee, whether as wages or vacation pay or in the form of any other benefit or for any other reason. 
              11. 
    No Right to Future Awards or Employment  .  This award is a voluntary, discretionary bonus being made on a one-time basis and it does not constitute a commitment to make any future awards.  This award and any payments made hereunder will not be considered salary or other compensation for purposes of any severance pay or similar allowance, except as otherwise required by law.  No provision of this Agreement shall limit in any way whatsoever any right that the Company or a Subsidiary may otherwise have to terminate Grantee s employment at any time.  
              12. 
    Relation to Other Benefits  .  Any economic or other benefit to Grantee under this Agreement or the Plan shall not be taken into account in determining any benefits to which Grantee may be entitled  
     
   7 

under any profit-sharing, retirement or other benefit or compensation plan maintained by the Company or a Subsidiary and shall not affect the amount of any life insurance coverage available to any beneficiary under any life insurance plan covering employees of the Company or a Subsidiary.  
           13. 
    Processing of Information  .  Information about Grantee and Grantee s award of Common Shares and Deferred Cash Dividends may be collected, recorded and held, used and disclosed for any purpose related to the administration of the award.  Grantee understands that such processing of this information may need to be carried out by the Company and its Subsidiaries and by third party administrators whether such persons are located within Grantee s country or elsewhere, including the United States of America.  Grantee consents to the processing of information relating to Grantee and Grantee s receipt of the Common Shares and Deferred Cash Dividends in any one or more of the ways referred to above.  
              14. 
    Amendments  .  Any amendment to the Plan shall be deemed to be an amendment to this Agreement to the extent that the amendment is applicable hereto;   provided  ,   however  , that subject to the provisions of Section 8 hereof no amendment shall adversely affect the rights of Grantee with respect to either the Common Shares or other securities covered by this Agreement or the Deferred Cash Dividends without Grantee s consent.  
              15. 
    Severability  .  If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any provision hereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision in any other person or circumstances shall not be affected, and the provisions so held to be invalid or unenforceable shall be reformed to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary to make it enforceable and valid.  
              16. 
    Governing Law  .  This Agreement is made under, and shall be construed in accordance with, the internal substantive laws of the State of Ohio.

     Grantee should die or become permanently disabled during the period that

   2 

with the Company or its successor in the Change in Control (or another entity that is affiliated with the Company or its successor following the Change in Control) (the  Successor ) for Good Reason by Grantee or without Cause (as defined in Section 2(d)) by the Successor within a period of two years after the Change in Control, and (F) the other terms and conditions of which are not less favorable to Grantee than the terms and conditions of the Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends then accumulated with respect thereto (including the provisions that would apply in the event of a subsequent Change in Control).

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Replacement Award may take the form of a continuation of the Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends then accumulated with respect thereto if the requirements of the preceding sentence are satisfied. The determination of whether the conditions of this Section 2(b)(ii) are satisfied will be made by the Committee, as constituted immediately before the Change in Control, in its sole discretion.

              (ii) 
    If a Replacement Award is provided, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any outstanding Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends then accumulated with respect thereto which at the time of the Change in Control are not subject to a  substantial risk of forfeiture  (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) will be deemed to be nonforfeitable at the time of such Change in Control.  
              (a) 
    Divestiture  :  If Grantee s employment with the Company or a Subsidiary terminates as the result of a divestiture, then the Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends then accumulated with respect thereto shall become nonforfeitable in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section 1(a) as if Grantee had remained in the continuous employ of the Company or a Subsidiary from the Date of Grant until the fifth anniversary of the Date of Grant or the occurrence of a circumstance referenced in Section 2(a) or 2(b), whichever occurs first.      For the purposes of this Agreement, the term  divestiture  shall mean a permanent disposition to a Person other than the Company or any Subsidiary of a plant or other facility or property at which Grantee performs a majority of Grantee s services whether such disposition is effected by means of a sale of assets, a sale of Subsidiary stock or otherwise. 
              (b) 
    Termination Without Cause  :  Subject to Section 5(c) hereof, if (i) Grantee s employment with the Company or a Subsidiary terminates as the result of a termination by the Company or a Subsidiary other than for Cause (a  Termination Without Cause ) and (ii) Grantee is entitled to receive severance pay pursuant to the terms of any severance pay plan of the Company in  
     
   3 

effect at the time of Grantee s termination of employment that provides for severance pay calculated by multiplying Grantee s base compensation by a specified severance period, then Grantee s right to receive the Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends then accumulated with respect thereto shall become nonforfeitable in accordance with the terms and conditions of, and over the time period described in, Section 1(a) as if Grantee had remained in the continuous employ of the Company or a Subsidiary from the Date of Grant until the date of the fifth anniversary of the Date of Grant or the occurrence of a circumstance referenced in Section 2(a) or 2(b), whichever occurs first; provided, however, that if the specified severance period ends before the date of the fifth anniversary of the Date of Grant, Grantee s right to receive the Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends accumulated with respect thereto shall be forfeited automatically at the end of the severance period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Grantee s employment is Terminated Without Cause after Grantee becomes eligible for retirement at or after age 62, then Section 1(b) shall govern.    
    For purposes of this Agreement,  Cause  shall mean:  (i) an intentional act of fraud, embezzlement or theft in connection with Grantee s duties with the Company or a Subsidiary (or the Successor, if applicable); (ii) an intentional wrongful disclosure of secret processes or confidential information of the Company or a Subsidiary (or the Successor, if applicable); (iii) an intentional, wrongful engagement in any competitive activity that would constitute a material breach of Grantee s duty of loyalty to the Company or a Subsidiary (or the Successor, if applicable); (iv) the willful misconduct in the performance of the Grantee s duties to the Company or a Subsidiary (or the Successor, if applicable); or (v) gross negligence in the performance of Grantee s duties to the company or a Subsidiary (or the Successor, if applicable).

           1.

Grantee s right to receive the Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends accumulated with respect thereto shall be forfeited automatically and without further notice on the date that Grantee ceases to be an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary prior to the fifth anniversary of the Date of Grant for any reason other than as described in Sections 1 or 2 hereof.  In the event that Grantee shall intentionally commit an act that the Committee determines to be materially adverse to the interests of the Company or a Subsidiary, Grantee s right to receive the Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends accumulated with respect thereto shall be forfeited at the time of that determination notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary.

In the event such Review Period begins in 1 taxable year of the Grantee, and ends in a 2   nd    taxable year of the Grantee, then to the extent necessary to avoid any penalties or additional taxes under Section 409A of the Code, no payment shall be made before the 2   nd    taxable year. 
              4. 
    Compliance with Law  .  The Company shall make reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws;   provided  ,   however  , notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated to issue any of the Common Shares covered by this Agreement or pay any Deferred Cash Dividends accumulated with respect thereto if the issuance or payment thereof would result in violation of any such law.  To the extent that the Ohio Securities Act shall be applicable to this Agreement, the Company shall not be obligated to issue any of the Common Shares or other securities covered by this Agreement or pay any Deferred Cash

           5. 
    Transferability  .  Neither Grantee s right to receive the Common Shares covered by this Agreement nor his right to receive any Deferred Cash Dividends shall be transferable by Grantee except by will  
     
   5 

or the laws of descent and distribution.  Any purported transfer in violation of this Section 7 shall be null and void, and the purported transferee shall obtain no rights with respect to such Shares.  
           6. 
    Compliance with Section 409A of the Code  .  To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Agreement and the Plan comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code.  This Agreement and the Plan shall be administered in a manner consistent with this intent.  
              7. 
    Adjustments  .  Subject to Section 12 of the Plan, the Committee shall make any adjustments in the number or kind of shares of stock or other securities covered by this Agreement, and other terms and provisions, that the Committee shall determine to be equitably required to prevent any dilution or expansion of Grantee s rights under this Agreement that otherwise would result from any (a) stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the Company, (b) merger, consolidation, separation, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other distribution of assets involving the Company or (c) other transaction or event having an effect similar to any of those referred to in subsection (a) or (b) herein.  Furthermore, in the event that any transaction or event described or referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, or a Change in Control, shall occur, the Committee shall provide in substitution of any or all of Grantee s rights under this Agreement such alternative consideration (including cash) as the Committee shall determine in good faith to be equitable under the circumstances.  
              8. 
    Withholding Taxes  .  To the extent that the Company is required to withhold federal, state, local or foreign taxes in connection with any delivery of Common Shares to Grantee, and the amounts available to the Company for such withholding are insufficient, it shall be a condition to the receipt of such delivery that Grantee make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for payment of the balance of such taxes required to be withheld.  Grantee may elect that all or any part of such withholding requirement be satisfied by retention by the Company of a portion of the Common Shares delivered to Grantee. Any Common Shares so withheld shall be credited against such withholding requirements at the market value of such shares on the date of such withholding. 
              9. 
    Detrimental Activity and Recapture  .  
              (a) 
    In the event that, as determined by the Committee, Grantee shall engage in Detrimental Activity during employment with the Company or a Subsidiary, the Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends accumulated with respect thereto will be forfeited automatically and without further notice at the time of that determination notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement.  Nothing in this Agreement prevents Grantee from providing, without prior notice to the Company, information to governmental authorities regarding possible legal violations or otherwise testifying or participating in any investigation or proceeding by any governmental authorities regarding possible legal violations. 
              (b) 
    If a Restatement occurs and the Committee determines that Grantee is personally responsible for causing the Restatement as a result of Grantee s personal misconduct or any fraudulent activity on the part of Grantee, then the Committee has discretion to, based on applicable facts and circumstances and subject to applicable law, cause the Company to recover all or any portion (but no more than 100%) of the Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends accumulated with respect thereto earned or payable to Grantee for some or all of the years covered by the Restatement. The amount of any earned or payable Common Shares covered by this Agreement and any Deferred Cash Dividends accumulated with respect thereto recovered by the Company shall be limited to the amount by which such earned or payable Common Shares and Deferred Cash Dividends exceeded the amount that would have been earned by or paid to Grantee had the Company s financial statements for the applicable restated fiscal year or years been initially filed as restated, as reasonably determined by the Committee. The Committee shall also determine whether the Company shall effect any recovery under this Section 11(b) by: (i) seeking repayment from Grantee;  
     
   6 

(ii) reducing, except with respect to any non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, the amount that would otherwise be payable to Grantee under any compensatory plan, program or arrangement maintained by the Company (subject to applicable law and the terms and conditions of such plan, program or arrangement); (iii) by withholding, except with respect to any non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, payment of future increases in compensation (including the payment of any discretionary bonus amount) that would otherwise have been made to Grantee in accordance with the Company s compensation practices; or (iv) by any combination of these alternatives.  For purposes of this Agreement,  Restatement  means a restatement of any part of the Company s financial statements for any fiscal year or years beginning with the year in which the Date of Grant occurs due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the U.S. securities laws applicable to such fiscal year or years.  
           10. 
    Clawback  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if Grantee breaches any of Grantee s obligations under any non-competition or other restrictive covenant agreement that it has entered into with the Company or a Subsidiary, including the Nondisclosure and Assignment Agreement attached hereto as   Exhibit A   (the  Non-Competition Agreement ), to the extent permissible by local law, Grantee shall forfeit any Common Shares and any Deferred Cash Dividends.  In addition, in the event that Grantee breaches the Non-Competition Agreement, if the Company shall so determine, Grantee shall, promptly upon notice of such determination, (a) return to the Company, all the Common Shares that Grantee has received but not disposed of that became nonforfeitable pursuant to this Agreement, (b) with respect to any Common Shares so issued pursuant to this Agreement that Grantee has disposed of, pay to the Company in cash the aggregate Market Value per Share of those Common Shares on the date on which the Common Shares were issued under this Agreement, and (c) return to the Company any cash amount paid with respect to the Deferred Cash Dividends, in each case as reasonably determined by the Company.  To the extent that such amounts are not promptly paid to the Company, the Company may set off the amounts so payable to it against any amounts (other than amounts of non-qualified deferred compensation as so defined under Section 409A of the Code) that may be owing from time to time by the Company or a Subsidiary to Grantee, whether as wages or vacation pay or in the form of any other benefit or for any other reason. 
              11. 
    No Right to Future Awards or Employment  .  This award is a voluntary, discretionary bonus being made on a one-time basis and it does not constitute a commitment to make any future awards.  This award and any payments made hereunder will not be considered salary or other compensation for purposes of any severance pay or similar allowance, except as otherwise required by law.  No provision of this Agreement shall limit in any way whatsoever any right that the Company or a Subsidiary may otherwise have to terminate Grantee s employment at any time.  
              12. 
    Relation to Other Benefits  .  Any economic or other benefit to Grantee under this Agreement or the Plan shall not be taken into account in determining any benefits to which Grantee may be entitled under any profit-sharing, retirement or other benefit or compensation plan maintained by the Company or a Subsidiary and shall not affect the amount of any life insurance coverage available to any beneficiary under any life insurance plan covering employees of the Company or a Subsidiary.  
              13. 
    Processing of Information  .  Information about Grantee and Grantee s award of Common Shares and Deferred Cash Dividends may be collected, recorded and held, used and disclosed for any purpose related to the administration of the award.  Grantee understands that such processing of this information may need to be carried out by the Company and its Subsidiaries and by third party administrators whether such persons are located within Grantee s country or elsewhere, including the United States of America.  Grantee consents to the processing of information relating to Grantee and Grantee s receipt of the Common Shares and Deferred Cash Dividends in any one or more of the ways referred to above.  
     
   7 

14. 
    Amendments  .  Any amendment to the Plan shall be deemed to be an amendment to this Agreement to the extent that the amendment is applicable hereto;   provided  ,   however  , that subject to the provisions of Section 8 hereof no amendment shall adversely affect the rights of Grantee with respect to either the Common Shares or other securities covered by this Agreement or the Deferred Cash Dividends without Grantee s consent.  
              15. 
    Severability  .  If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any provision hereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision in any other person or circumstances shall not be affected, and the provisions so held to be invalid or unenforceable shall be reformed to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary to make it enforceable and valid.  
              16.

Exhibit 10.5 
    
   AMENDED AND RESTATED 
  SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN 
  OF THE TIMKEN COMPANY 
  (Amended and Restated Effective as of June 30, 2014) 
    
  The Timken Company ( Timken ) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries MPB Corporation, and The Timken Corporation (collectively the  Company ) hereby amend and restate the Supplemental Pension Plan of The Timken Company (the  Supplemental Plan ), originally effective May 14, 1979, for the following purpose and in accordance with the provisions as set forth below.  Two prior amendments and restatements of the Supplemental Plan were effective as of January 1, 2009 and January 1, 2011, and another amendment and restatement of the Supplemental Plan was effective as of June 1, 2013.  This amendment and restatement of the Supplemental Plan is effective as of June 30, 2014.   
    
  Effective as of June 30, 2014 (the  Split Date ), certain liabilities of this Supplemental Plan attributable to the benefits accrued for the Transferred Participants will be spun off and transferred to the Supplemental Pension Plan of TimkenSteel Corporation (the  TimkenSteel Supplemental Plan ), which has been established by the TimkenSteel Corporation ( TimkenSteel ) as a continuation of this Supplemental Plan solely with respect to such Transferred Participants.  On and after the Split Date, such Transferred Participants shall cease to be Participants under the Supplemental Plan and shall become participants under the TimkenSteel Supplemental Plan. 
     The purpose of the Supplemental Plan is to provide for, on or after the effective date hereof, the payment of supplemental retirement benefits: 
  (a)  to those participants of certain qualified defined benefit plans of the Company whose benefits payable under such qualified defined benefit plans of the Company are subject to certain benefit limitations imposed by ERISA and Section 401 and Section 415 of the Code (collectively referred to as  Code Limitations  and 
  (b)  to certain employees of the Company who have Employee Excess Benefits Agreements ( Excess Agreements ) that are in effect with the Company. 
           2. 
    Eligibility 
     Each of the following individuals shall be eligible for benefits under the Supplemental Plan and shall be known as a  Participant : 
  (a)  Members of or participants in (i) The Timken Company Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees, (ii) prior to January 1, 2012, the 1984 Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees of The Timken Company, and (iii) the TLMT Plan but only to the extent the members or participants are members or participants pursuant to Part Seven, Part Eight, Part Ten (other than Kilian Participants, as defined in Part Ten), and, effective January 1, 2012, Part Fifteen of the TLMT Plan (the plans, or portions of plans, identified in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) being collectively the  Qualified Plan ), other than participants described in paragraph 2(c), who are eligible for a retirement benefit other than a deferred vested pension and whose retirement benefits under the Qualified Plan are limited pursuant to the Code Limitations; 
  (b)  Except as otherwise provided below with respect to the Transferred Participants, (i)  Former employees of the Company who separated from the service of the Company, and (ii) current employees of the Company who separate from the service of the Company, in each case under circumstances which the Company, in its sole discretion, deems to be for mutually satisfactory reasons and in each case with eligibility for a deferred vested pension and whose retirement benefits under the Qualified Plan are limited by the Code Limitations; and  
  
   1 

(c)  Employees of the Company who have Excess Agreements currently in effect with the Company. 
  Notwithstanding anything in this Supplemental Plan to the contrary, effective as of the Split Date, the Transferred Participants shall cease to be Participants under this Supplemental Plan. 
           3. 
    Incorporation of the Qualified Plan 
     The Qualified Plan, with any amendments thereto, is hereby incorporated by reference into and shall be a part of the Supplemental Plan as fully as if set forth herein.  Any future amendment made to the Qualified Plan shall be also incorporated by reference into and form a part of the Supplemental Plan, effective as of the effective date of such amendment. The Qualified Plan, whenever referred to in the Supplemental Plan, shall mean such Qualified Plan as it exists as of the date any determination is made of benefits payable under the Supplemental Plan.  All terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them under the provisions of the Qualified Plan unless otherwise qualified by the context of the Supplemental Plan.  If there is any conflict between the provisions of the Qualified Plan and the provisions of the Supplemental Plan, the provisions of the Supplemental Plan will govern. 
           4. 
    Amount of Benefit 
     (a)  The benefit payable to a Participant described in paragraphs 2(a) or (b) under the Supplemental Plan shall be equal to the excess, if any, of: 
           (i) 
    The benefit which would have been payable to such Participant under the Qualified Plan, if the provisions of the Qualified Plan were administered without regard to the Code Limitations, over 
              (ii) 
    The benefit which is in fact payable to such Participant under the Qualified Plan.   
              (iii) 
    Such benefits payable under the Supplemental Plan to any Participant shall be computed in accordance with the foregoing using the normal form of payment under the Qualified Plan and with the objective that such Participant should receive under the Supplemental Plan and the Qualified Plan the total amount which would otherwise have been payable to that Participant solely under the Qualified Plan had not the Code Limitations been applicable thereto.  The Participant s benefit under the Supplemental Plan will be paid in the form provided under paragraph 5(a).  If any portion of a Participant s benefit under the Qualified Plan is not payable at the same time the Participant s benefit under the Supplemental Plan is payable, for purposes of this paragraph 4, the corresponding portion of the benefit under the Supplemental Plan shall be determined by calculating that portion of the benefit that would be payable under the Supplemental Plan and Qualified Plan at age 65 and then actuarially reducing such benefit from age 65 to the commencement date provided under the Supplemental Plan in accordance with paragraph 5(b). 
              (iv) 
    Any actuarial adjustments under this paragraph 4 shall be based on the Plan Assumptions and, for this purpose, the determinations made under this paragraph 4(a) will be made in the calendar year in which the Participant has a separation from service (as defined in paragraph 5). 
     (b)  The benefit payable to a Participant described in paragraph 2(c) under the Supplemental Plan shall be the benefit described in such Participant s Excess Agreement. 
  (c)    
           (i) 
    If a Participant dies prior to commencement of the Participant s benefit payments pursuant to paragraph 5(b) and the Participant has a Spouse on his or her date of death who is not eligible for a benefit under an Excess Agreement, the Supplemental Plan shall pay to the Participant s Spouse an amount equal to the difference between the monthly pension the Spouse would be entitled to receive under the Qualified Plan, were it not for the Code Limitations, and the monthly pension the Spouse will actually receive under the Qualified Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant s  
     
   2 

Lump Sum Beneficiary is entitled to receive a benefit under paragraph 4(c)(ii), the Participant s Spouse is not entitled to receive any benefit under this paragraph 4(c)(i). 
           (ii) 
    If a Participant who is eligible for a benefit described in paragraph 4(a) and who has elected a Lump Sum Option pursuant to a Subsequent Election, dies after the date the Participant s benefit would have commenced but for such Subsequent Election and prior to the Delayed Payment Date, the Supplemental Plan shall pay to the Participant s Lump Sum Beneficiary an amount equal to the benefit that the Participant would have received had the Participant commenced his benefit one day prior to his death (such amount to include any interest accrued up to the Participant s date of death as provided under paragraph 5(a)(iv)(D))  . 
              5. 
    Payment of Benefits 
     (a)  Form of Payment. 
           (i) 
    Participants  .  Subject to the provisions of any domestic relations order described in paragraph 7(b), the benefits payable to Participants described in paragraphs 2(a), (b) or (c) (unless otherwise provided in an Excess Agreement with a Participant) under the Supplemental Plan shall be paid in the form of a monthly annuity for the life of the Participant (a  Life Annuity ) if the Participant does not have an Initial Election or Subsequent Election for the Lump Sum Option in effect.  In lieu of receiving his or her benefit in the form of a Life Annuity, at any time prior to the date benefit payments are to commence in the form of a Life Annuity in accordance with paragraph 5(b) or the Excess Agreement, if applicable, a Participant described in paragraphs 2(a), (b) or (c) (if provided for in the Excess Agreement with Participant) may elect, on a written form acceptable to the Company, to receive his or her benefit in one of the following forms (the  Optional Forms ), each of which are actuarially equivalent to the Life Annuity: 
              (A) 
    Joint Pension Option  .  The Joint Pension Option provides for monthly benefit payments to the Participant during his or her lifetime and thereafter to the Participant s duly named joint pensioner, who shall be a natural person.  The amount of each benefit payment to the Participant will be reduced so that the joint pensioner after the Participant s death will receive a monthly benefit equivalent to 25%, 50%, 75% or 100%, as elected by the Participant at the time the Joint Pension Option is elected, of the monthly benefit paid to the Participant during his or her lifetime.  If the joint pensioner dies after benefit payments to the Participant have started, the benefits will only be payable for the Participant s lifetime. 
              (B) 
    Ten Year Certain and Continuous Pension Option  .  The Ten Year Certain and Continuous Pension Option provides monthly pension payments to the Participant during his lifetime and if he dies after benefit payments have started but before receiving 120 benefit payments, the remainder of the 120 monthly benefit payments will be paid to the Participant s beneficiary monthly.   
     If a Participant elects an Optional Form that provides for a benefit to a joint pensioner or beneficiary, such joint pensioner or beneficiary shall be designated at the time the Participant elects such Optional Form.  If a Participant has a DOMA Spouse and wants to designate a joint pensioner or beneficiary other than his or her DOMA Spouse, such designation will not take effect unless (i) the Participant s DOMA Spouse consents in writing to such election, the election designates a beneficiary or a form of benefits which may not be changed without spousal consent (or the consent of the DOMA Spouse expressly permits designations by the Participant without any requirement of further consent by the DOMA Spouse), and the DOMA Spouse's consent  
  
   3 

acknowledges the effect of such election and is witnessed by a Plan representative or a notary public, or (ii) it is established to the satisfaction of a Plan representative that the consent required under (i) cannot be obtained because there is no DOMA Spouse, because the DOMA Spouse cannot be located, or because of such other circumstances as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe by regulations.  Any consent by a DOMA Spouse or establishment that the consent of a DOMA Spouse may not be obtained shall be effective only with respect  to such DOMA Spouse. 
           (ii) 
    Surviving Spouse and Lump Sum Beneficiary  .  Subject  to paragraphs 5(a)(iii) and 5(a)(iv), any benefit payable to a surviving Spouse pursuant to paragraph 4(c)(i), shall be paid in the form of a monthly annuity for the life of the surviving Spouse.  Any benefit payable to a Lump Sum Beneficiary pursuant to paragraph 4(c)(ii) shall be paid in a single, lump sum cash payment. 
              (iii) 
    Election of Lump Sum Option Upon Initial Eligibility  .   
              (A) 
    Any Participant who is described in paragraphs 2(a) or (b) and who first accrues a benefit under the Supplemental Plan on and after January 1, 2011, may make an initial election, subject to the requirements of clause (B), below to receive his or her benefit and to provide that his or her Spouse will receive any Spouse s benefit under the Supplemental Plan in the form of a single, lump sum, cash payment determined using the Plan Assumptions (a    Lump Sum Option   ) in lieu of receiving the benefits in the forms provided for under paragraphs 5(a)(i) and 5(a)(ii).  Any such election that does not meet all of the requirements of this paragraph 5(a)(iii) shall not be valid and, in such case, such election shall be disregarded.  A Participant s or Spouse s benefit paid in a Lump Sum Option will be the actuarial equivalent (determined in the calendar year benefits commence, or would commence but for any delay pursuant to paragraph 5(c), using the Plan Assumptions) of the Participant s or Spouse s benefit payable in the form a monthly annuity for the life of the Participant (for the Participant s benefit) or the life of the Spouse (for the Spouse s benefit) and commencing on the date specified in paragraph 5(b).  
              (B) 
    A Participant may only make an election described under paragraph 5(a)(iii)(A) if the election (1) is completed, in writing, signed by the Participant, in a form acceptable to the Plan Administrator, and (2) is received by the Plan Administrator no later than 30 days after the first day of the Participant s tax year immediately following the first year the Participant accrues a benefit under the Supplemental Plan.  Any election made under this paragraph 5(a)(iii) will be irrevocable on the date the fully completed election form is received by the Plan Administrator.  
              (iv) 
    Subsequent Election of Lump Sum Option  .  
              (A) 
    Each Plan Year, Timken may, in its discretion, designate a period of time during which a Participant described in paragraphs 2(a), (b) or (c) (unless otherwise provided in an Excess Agreement), who is an employee of the Company on or after January 1, 2011 and who did not make an Initial Lump Sum Election, may make an election, subject to the requirements of clauses (B) and (C) below, to receive his or her benefit and to provide that his or her Spouse will receive any Spouse s benefit under the Supplemental Plan or, if applicable, the Excess Agreement, in the form of a Lump Sum Option in lieu of receiving the benefits in the forms provided for under paragraphs 5(a)(i) and 5(a)(ii) and, if applicable, the forms provided under the Excess Agreement.   
     
   4 

(B) 
    A Participant s election described under paragraph 5(a)(iv)(A) must be filed with the Plan Administrator, in writing, signed by the Participant, in a form acceptable to the Plan Administrator (which for a Participant described in paragraph 2(c) may include an amendment to the Participant s Excess Agreement) and must meet the following requirements:  (1) the election is made at least 12 months prior to the date the Participant s benefit would have commenced but for the Subsequent Election (if the commencement date is the Participant s birthday or other specified time or fixed schedule described in Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-3(a)(4))  ;   (2) except for a benefit being paid as a result of the Participant s death, the payment under such election will be made  on the date that is 5 years after the first date the Participant s benefit could have commenced but for the Subsequent Election (the  Delayed Payment Date  and (3) such election will not take effect until the date that is 12 months after the date on which such election becomes irrevocable.

     Within 60 days of the date determined pursuant to clause (i) above, the Plan Administrator shall conduct a full and fair review of the decision denying the Claimant s claim for benefits. Within 60 days of the date of such hearing, the Plan Administrator shall render its written decision on review, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant and including the reasons and Plan provisions upon which its decision was based, a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents and other information relevant to the claim, and a statement describing the Claimant s right to bring an action under Section 502(a) of ERISA. 
           9. 
    Amendment and Termination 
     (a)  Timken has reserved and does hereby reserve the right to amend, restate or terminate, at any time, any or all of the provisions of the Supplemental Plan, without the consent of any Participant, Spouse, beneficiary, or any other person.  Without limiting the authority of the Board of Directors of Timken or a duly authorized committee thereof to amend, restate or terminate the Supplemental Plan, the Board of Directors of Timken has authorized and instructed its Senior Vice President - Human Resources and Organizational Advancement (or any other officer or delegate of an officer) to amend, restate or terminate the Plan.  Any amendment, restatement or termination of the Plan shall be expressed in an instrument executed in the name of Timken.  Any such amendment, restatement or termination shall become effective as of the date designated in such instrument or, if no such date is specified, on the date of its execution. 
  (b)  Notwithstanding paragraph 9(a) hereof, no amendment, restatement or termination of the Supplemental Plan shall, without the consent of the Participant (or, in the case of his or her death, his or her beneficiary or Spouse, as applicable), adversely affect (i) the benefit under the Supplemental Plan of any Participant, Spouse or beneficiary then entitled to receive a benefit under the Supplemental Plan or (ii) the right of any Participant to receive upon termination of employment with the Company (or the right of the Participant s Spouse or other beneficiary, as applicable, to receive upon the Participant s death) that benefit which would have been received under the Supplemental Plan if such employment of the Participant had terminated immediately prior to the amendment, restatement or termination of the Supplemental Plan; provided, however, that the consent requirement of Participants, Spouses or other beneficiaries to certain actions shall not apply to any amendment or termination made by the Company pursuant to paragraph 11(b).  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, Timken, in its sole discretion, may terminate this Supplemental Plan in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix), or any successor provision.   
           10. 
    Restriction on Competition 
     For a period of two years following a Participant s separation from service, the Participant shall not (a) engage or participate, directly or indirectly, in any Competitive Activity (as defined below), or (b) solicit or cause to be solicited on behalf of a competitor any person or entity which was a customer of the Company during the three year period ending on the Participant s retirement date, if the Participant had any direct responsibility for such customer while employed by the Company.  The term  Competitive Activity  shall mean the Participant s participation, without the written consent of an officer of the Company, in the management of any business enterprise if such enterprise engages in substantial and direct competition with the Company and such enterprise s sales of any product or service competitive with any product or service of the Company amounted to 25% of such enterprise s net sales for its most recently completed fiscal year  
  
   9 

and if the Company s net sales of said product or service amounted to 25% of the Company s net sales for its most recently completed fiscal year.   Competitive Activity  shall not include (y) the mere ownership of securities in any enterprise and exercise of rights appurtenant thereto or (z) participation in management of any enterprise or business operation thereof other than in connection with the competitive operation of such enterprise.  If a Participant engages in activity prohibited by this paragraph, then in addition to all other remedies available to the Company, the Company shall be released of any obligation under the Supplemental Plan to pay benefits to such Participant or to such Participant s Spouse or beneficiary under the Supplemental Plan. 
   (a)  To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Supplemental Plan (including all amendments thereto) comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, so that the income inclusion provisions of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code do not apply to the     Participant, Spouse or a beneficiary.  This Supplemental Plan shall be administered in a manner consistent with this intent.  
  (b)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Supplemental Plan to the contrary, in light of the uncertainty with respect to the proper application of Section 409A of the Code, Timken reserves the right to make amendments to this Supplemental Plan as Timken deems necessary or desirable to avoid the imposition of taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code.  In any case, a Participant shall be solely responsible and liable for the satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that may be imposed on a Participant or for a Participant s account in connection with this Supplemental Plan (including any taxes and penalties under Section 409A of the Code), and neither the Company nor any of its affiliates shall have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise hold a Participant harmless from any or all of such taxes or penalties.

Exhibit 10.7 
    
   AMENDED AND RESTATED 
  SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN 
  OF THE TIMKEN COMPANY 
  (Amended and Restated Effective as of October 1, 2018) 
    
  The Timken Company ( Timken  or the  Company ) hereby amends and restates the Supplemental Pension Plan of The Timken Company (the  Supplemental Plan ), originally effective May 14, 1979, for the following purpose and in accordance with the provisions as set forth below.  Three prior amendments and restatements of the Supplemental Plan were effective as of January 1, 2009, January 1, 2011 and June 1, 2013.  Another amendment and restatement of the Supplemental Plan was effective as of June 30, 2014.   
  Effective as of June 30, 2014 (the  Split Date ), certain liabilities of this Supplemental Plan attributable to the benefits accrued for the Transferred Participants were spun off and transferred to the Supplemental Pension Plan of TimkenSteel Corporation (the  TimkenSteel Supplemental Plan ), which was established by the TimkenSteel Corporation ( TimkenSteel ) as a continuation of this Supplemental Plan solely with respect to such Transferred Participants.  On and after the Split Date, such Transferred Participants ceased to be Participants under the Supplemental Plan and became participants under the TimkenSteel Supplemental Plan. 
  This amendment and restatement of the Supplemental Plan is effective as of October 1, 2018.  
     The purpose of the Supplemental Plan is to provide for, on or after the effective date hereof, the payment of supplemental retirement benefits: 
  (a)  to those participants of certain qualified defined benefit plans of the Company whose benefits payable under such qualified defined benefit plans of the Company are subject to certain benefit limitations imposed by ERISA and Section 401 and Section 415 of the Code (collectively referred to as  Code Limitations  and 
  (b)  to certain employees of the Company who have Employee Excess Benefits Agreements ( Excess Agreements ) that are in effect with the Company. 
           2. 
    Eligibility 
     Each of the following individuals shall be eligible for benefits under the Supplemental Plan and shall be known as a  Participant : 
  (a)  Members of or participants in (i) The Timken Company Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees, (ii) prior to January 1, 2012, the 1984 Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees of The Timken Company, and (iii) the TLMT Plan but only to the extent the members or participants are members or participants pursuant to Part Seven, Part Eight, Part Ten (other than Kilian Participants, as defined in Part Ten), and, effective January 1, 2012, Part Fifteen of the TLMT Plan (the plans, or portions of plans, identified in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) being collectively the  Qualified Plan ), other than participants described in paragraph 2(c), who are eligible for a retirement benefit other than a deferred vested pension and whose retirement benefits under the Qualified Plan are limited pursuant to the Code Limitations; 
  (b)  Except as otherwise provided below with respect to the Transferred Participants, (i)  Former employees of the Company who separated from the service of the Company, and (ii) current employees of the Company who separate from the service of the Company, in each case under circumstances which the Company, in its sole discretion, deems to be for mutually satisfactory reasons and in each case with eligibility for a deferred vested pension and whose retirement benefits under the Qualified Plan are limited by the Code Limitations; and  
  (c)  Employees of the Company who have Excess Agreements currently in effect with the Company. 

Notwithstanding anything in this Supplemental Plan to the contrary, (i) effective as of the Split Date, the Transferred Participants shall cease to be Participants under this Supplemental Plan, and (ii) no individual will become a Participant after December 31, 2022.  
           3. 
    Incorporation of the Qualified Plan 
     The Qualified Plan, with any amendments thereto, is hereby incorporated by reference into and shall be a part of the Supplemental Plan as fully as if set forth herein.  Any future amendment made to the Qualified Plan shall be also incorporated by reference into and form a part of the Supplemental Plan, effective as of the effective date of such amendment. The Qualified Plan, whenever referred to in the Supplemental Plan, shall mean such Qualified Plan as it exists as of the date any determination is made of benefits payable under the Supplemental Plan.  All terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them under the provisions of the Qualified Plan unless otherwise qualified by the context of the Supplemental Plan.  If there is any conflict between the provisions of the Qualified Plan and the provisions of the Supplemental Plan, the provisions of the Supplemental Plan will govern. 
           4. 
    Amount of Benefit 
     (a)  The benefit payable to a Participant described in paragraphs 2(a) or (b) under the Supplemental Plan shall be equal to the excess, if any, of: 
           (i) 
    The benefit which would have been payable to such Participant under the Qualified Plan, if the provisions of the Qualified Plan were administered without regard to the Code Limitations, over 
              (ii) 
    The benefit which is in fact payable to such Participant under the Qualified Plan.   
              (iii) 
    Such benefits payable under the Supplemental Plan to any Participant shall be computed in accordance with the foregoing using the normal form of payment under the Qualified Plan and with the objective that such Participant should receive under the Supplemental Plan and the Qualified Plan the total amount which would otherwise have been payable to that Participant solely under the Qualified Plan had not the Code Limitations been applicable thereto.  The Participant s benefit under the Supplemental Plan will be paid in the form provided under paragraph 5(a).  If any portion of a Participant s benefit under the Qualified Plan is not payable at the same time the Participant s benefit under the Supplemental Plan is payable, for purposes of this paragraph 4, the corresponding portion of the benefit under the Supplemental Plan shall be determined by calculating that portion of the benefit that would be payable under the Supplemental Plan and Qualified Plan at age 65 and then actuarially reducing such benefit from age 65 to the commencement date provided under the Supplemental Plan in accordance with paragraph 5(b). 
              (iv) 
    Any actuarial adjustments under this paragraph 4 shall be based on the Plan Assumptions and, for this purpose, the determinations made under this paragraph 4(a) will be made in the calendar year in which the Participant has a separation from service (as defined in paragraph 5). 
     (b)  The benefit payable to a Participant described in paragraph 2(c) under the Supplemental Plan shall be the benefit described in such Participant s Excess Agreement. 
  (c)    
           (i) 
    If a Participant dies prior to commencement of the Participant s benefit payments pursuant to paragraph 5(b) and the Participant has a Spouse on his or her date of death who is not eligible for a benefit under an Excess Agreement, the Supplemental Plan shall pay to the Participant s Spouse an amount equal to the difference between the monthly pension the Spouse would be entitled to receive under the Qualified Plan, were it not for the Code Limitations, and the monthly pension the Spouse will actually receive under the Qualified Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant s Lump Sum Beneficiary is entitled to receive a  

benefit under paragraph 4(c)(ii), the Participant s Spouse is not entitled to receive any benefit under this paragraph 4(c)(i). 
           (ii) 
    If a Participant who is eligible for a benefit described in paragraph 4(a) and who has elected a Lump Sum Option pursuant to a Subsequent Election, dies after the date the Participant s benefit would have commenced but for such Subsequent Election and prior to the Delayed Payment Date, the Supplemental Plan shall pay to the Participant s Lump Sum Beneficiary an amount equal to the benefit that the Participant would have received had the Participant commenced his benefit one day prior to his death (such amount to include any interest accrued up to the Participant s date of death as provided under paragraph 5(a)(iv)(D))  . 
       For the avoidance of doubt, because benefit accruals under the Qualified Plan will cease as of December 31, 2022, no Participant or Spouse will accrue any additional benefits under this Supplemental Plan after such date.  
           5. 
    Payment of Benefits 
     (a)  Form of Payment. 
           (i) 
    Participants  .  Subject to the provisions of any domestic relations order described in paragraph 7(b), the benefits payable to Participants described in paragraphs 2(a), (b) or (c) (unless otherwise provided in an Excess Agreement with a Participant) under the Supplemental Plan shall be paid in the form of a monthly annuity for the life of the Participant (a  Life Annuity ) if the Participant does not have an Initial Election or Subsequent Election for the Lump Sum Option in effect.  In lieu of receiving his or her benefit in the form of a Life Annuity, at any time prior to the date benefit payments are to commence in the form of a Life Annuity in accordance with paragraph 5(b) or the Excess Agreement, if applicable, a Participant described in paragraphs 2(a), (b) or (c) (if provided for in the Excess Agreement with Participant) may elect, on a written form acceptable to the Company, to receive his or her benefit in one of the following forms (the  Optional Forms ), each of which are actuarially equivalent to the Life Annuity: 
              (A) 
    Joint Pension Option  .  The Joint Pension Option provides for monthly benefit payments to the Participant during his or her lifetime and thereafter to the Participant s duly named joint pensioner, who shall be a natural person.  The amount of each benefit payment to the Participant will be reduced so that the joint pensioner after the Participant s death will receive a monthly benefit equivalent to 25%, 50%, 75% or 100%, as elected by the Participant at the time the Joint Pension Option is elected, of the monthly benefit paid to the Participant during his or her lifetime.  If the joint pensioner dies after benefit payments to the Participant have started, the benefits will only be payable for the Participant s lifetime. 
              (B) 
    Ten Year Certain and Continuous Pension Option  .  The Ten Year Certain and Continuous Pension Option provides monthly pension payments to the Participant during his lifetime and if he dies after benefit payments have started but before receiving 120 benefit payments, the remainder of the 120 monthly benefit payments will be paid to the Participant s beneficiary monthly.   
     If a Participant elects an Optional Form that provides for a benefit to a joint pensioner or beneficiary, such joint pensioner or beneficiary shall be designated at the time the Participant elects such Optional Form.  If a Participant has a Spouse and wants to designate a joint pensioner or beneficiary other than his or her Spouse, such designation will not take effect unless (i) the Participant s Spouse consents in  

writing to such election, the election designates a beneficiary or a form of benefits which may not be changed without spousal consent (or the consent of the Spouse expressly permits designations by the Participant without any requirement of further consent by the Spouse), and the Spouse's consent acknowledges the effect of such election and is witnessed by a Plan representative or a notary public, or (ii) it is established to the satisfaction of a Plan representative that the consent required under (i) cannot be obtained because there is no Spouse, because the Spouse cannot be located, or because of such other circumstances as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe by regulations.  Any consent by a Spouse or establishment that the consent of a Spouse may not be obtained shall be effective only with respect to such Spouse. 
           (ii) 
    Surviving Spouse and Lump Sum Beneficiary  .  Subject  to paragraphs 5(a)(iii) and 5(a)(iv), any benefit payable to a surviving Spouse pursuant to paragraph 4(c)(i), shall be paid in the form of a monthly annuity for the life of the surviving Spouse.  Any benefit payable to a Lump Sum Beneficiary pursuant to paragraph 4(c)(ii) shall be paid in a single, lump sum cash payment. 
              (iii) 
    Election of Lump Sum Option Upon Initial Eligibility  .   
              (A) 
    Any Participant who is described in paragraphs 2(a) or (b) and who first accrues a benefit under the Supplemental Plan on and after January 1, 2011, may make an initial election, subject to the requirements of clause (B), below to receive his or her benefit and to provide that his or her Spouse will receive any Spouse s benefit under the Supplemental Plan in the form of a single, lump sum, cash payment determined using the Plan Assumptions (a    Lump Sum Option   ) in lieu of receiving the benefits in the forms provided for under paragraphs 5(a)(i) and 5(a)(ii).  Any such election that does not meet all of the requirements of this paragraph 5(a)(iii) shall not be valid and, in such case, such election shall be disregarded.  A Participant s or Spouse s benefit paid in a Lump Sum Option will be the actuarial equivalent (determined in the calendar year benefits commence, or would commence but for any delay pursuant to paragraph 5(c), using the Plan Assumptions) of the Participant s or Spouse s benefit payable in the form a monthly annuity for the life of the Participant (for the Participant s benefit) or the life of the Spouse (for the Spouse s benefit) and commencing on the date specified in paragraph 5(b).  
              (B) 
    A Participant may only make an election described under paragraph 5(a)(iii)(A) if the election (1) is completed, in writing, signed by the Participant, in a form acceptable to the Plan Administrator, and (2) is received by the Plan Administrator no later than 30 days after the first day of the Participant s tax year immediately following the first year the Participant accrues a benefit under the Supplemental Plan.  Any election made under this paragraph 5(a)(iii) will be irrevocable on the date the fully completed election form is received by the Plan Administrator.  
              (iv) 
    Subsequent Election of Lump Sum Option  .  
              (A) 
    Each Plan Year, Timken may, in its discretion, designate a period of time during which a Participant described in paragraphs 2(a), (b) or (c) (unless otherwise provided in an Excess Agreement), who is an employee of the Company on or after January 1, 2011 and who did not make an Initial Lump Sum Election, may make an election, subject to the requirements of clauses (B) and (C) below, to receive his or her benefit and to provide that his or her  

Spouse will receive any Spouse s benefit under the Supplemental Plan or, if applicable, the Excess Agreement, in the form of a Lump Sum Option in lieu of receiving the benefits in the forms provided for under paragraphs 5(a)(i) and 5(a)(ii) and, if applicable, the forms provided under the Excess Agreement.   
           (B) 
    A Participant s election described under paragraph 5(a)(iv)(A) must be filed with the Plan Administrator, in writing, signed by the Participant, in a form acceptable to the Plan Administrator (which for a Participant described in paragraph 2(c) may include an amendment to the Participant s Excess Agreement) and must meet the following requirements:  (1) the election is made at least 12 months prior to the date the Participant s benefit would have commenced but for the Subsequent Election (if the commencement date is the Participant s birthday or other specified time or fixed schedule described in Treasury Regulation section 1.409A-3(a)(4)); (2) except for a benefit being paid as a result of the Participant s death, the payment under such election will be made  on the date that is 5 years after the first date the Participant s benefit could have commenced but for the Subsequent Election (the  Delayed Payment Date  and (3) such election will not take effect until the date that is 12 months after the date on which such election becomes irrevocable.  Any election made under this paragraph 5(a)(iv) will be irrevocable on the date the fully completed election forms (including an amendment to the Excess Agreement, if applicable) are received by the Plan Administrator.   
              (C) 
    Any such election that does not meet all of the requirements of this paragraph 5(a)(iv) shall not be valid and, in such case, shall be disregarded.  Except as provided in an Excess Agreement, a Participant s or Spouse s benefit paid in a Lump Sum Option will be the actuarial equivalent (determined in the calendar year benefits would have commenced but for the Subsequent Election and any delay pursuant to paragraph 5(c) using the Plan Assumptions) of the Participant or Spouse s benefit payable in the form of a monthly annuity for the life of the Participant (for the Participant s benefit) or the life of the Spouse (for the Spouse s benefit) and commencing on the date such benefit would have commenced but for the Subsequent Election.   
              (D) 
    If a Participant makes an effective election for a Lump Sum Option under this paragraph 5(a)(iv), his or her benefit will be increased at an annual rate equal to the Average Interest Rate for the period beginning on the date the Participant s benefit would have commenced but for the Subsequent Election and any delay pursuant to paragraph 5(c) and ending on the date the benefit actually commences.   
     (b)  Time of Payment  .  
           (i) 
    Participants  .  Subject to any required delay pursuant to paragraph 5(a)(iv)(B)(2), with respect to a Participant who is described in paragraphs 2(a), (b) or (c) (unless otherwise provided in an Excess Agreement with the Participant or in a Transition Election), the benefits payable to such Participant under this Supplemental Plan or the Excess Agreement, as applicable, shall commence within 30 days of the later of (A) the Participant s separation from service, or (B) the Participant s 55   th    birthday.  The term    Transition Election    means a Participant s election made on or before December 31, 2008 in accordance with IRS Notice 2007-86 and other applicable  

guidance under Code Section 409A to designate the time at which the Participant s benefits will commence.   
           (ii) 
    Surviving Spouses and Lump Sum Beneficiaries  .  Any benefit payable to a surviving Spouse or Lump Sum Beneficiary pursuant to paragraph 4(c) shall commence within 30 days of the later of (A) the Participant s death, or (B) the date on which the Participant would have reached age 55.   
     (c)  Delayed Benefits for Specified Employees  .  Notwithstanding any provision of this Supplemental Plan to the contrary, if a Participant is a  specified employee,  determined pursuant to procedures adopted by the Company in compliance with Section  409A of the Code, on the date the Participant separates from service, then to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A, amounts that would otherwise be payable pursuant to this Supplemental Plan during the six-month period immediately following the Participant s separation from service will instead be paid or made available on the earlier of (i) the first business day of the seventh month after the date of the Participant s separation from service, or (ii) the Participant s death.  Any benefit payments that are scheduled to be paid more than six months after such Participant s separation from service shall not be delayed and shall be paid in accordance with the schedule prescribed by paragraphs 5(a) and 5(b). 
  (d)  Small Benefit Cash-Out  .  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary but subject to paragraph 5(c), if, upon a Participant s separation from service, the actuarial present value of the benefit the Participant is entitled to receive under this Supplemental Plan and any other plans with respect to which deferrals of compensation are treated as having been deferred under a single nonqualified deferred compensation plan with the Supplemental Plan under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(c)(2) (the  Aggregate Benefit ) is less than $15,000, the Company may in its discretion pay the Participant s entire Aggregate Benefit in a single lump sum payment on the 30   th    day following the Participant s separation from service.  To determine the Aggregate Benefit under this paragraph 5(d), the Plan Assumptions will be used. 
  (e)  Separation from Service  .  For purposes of this paragraph 5,  separation from service  or  separates from service  shall mean termination of employment (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)(1)(ii)) with the Company and any member of its controlled group (as such term is used for purposes of ERISA and the Code, except that a 50% ownership or common control threshold shall be used to determine controlled group status instead of an 80% ownership or common control threshold).  For purposes of the preceding sentence a termination of employment shall also include a permanent decrease in the level of bona fide services performed by the Participant after a certain date to a level that is 20% or less of the average level of bona fide services performed by the Participant over the immediately preceding 36-month period.

in accordance with such agreement; and until any such payment is made, neither the Plan nor any Participant, Spouse or other beneficiary shall have any preferred claim on, or any beneficial ownership interest in, such assets.  Notwithstanding any provision of the Supplemental Plan to the contrary, no amounts shall be so transferred to a trust pursuant to the preceding sentence if, pursuant to Section 409A(b)(3)(A) of the Code, such amount would, for purposes of Section 83 of the Code, be treated as property transferred in connection with the performance of services.

  (b)  No right or interest of a Participant, Spouse or other beneficiary under the Supplemental Plan shall be anticipated, assigned (either at law or in equity), or alienated by the Participant, Spouse or other beneficiary, nor shall any such right or interest be subject to attachment, garnishment, levy, execution, or other legal or equitable process or in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts of any Participant, Spouse or other beneficiary.  The Company shall not recognize any attempt by any Participant, Spouse or other beneficiary to alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, or otherwise encumber his or her benefits under the Supplemental Plan or any part thereof.  To the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, this paragraph 7(b) shall not apply, however, in the case of  a domestic relations order that would be a  qualified domestic relations order  within the meaning of Section 206(d)(3) of ERISA if the Supplemental Plan was subject to Section 206(d)(3) of  ERISA.  Except as permitted under Section 409A of the Code, any deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) payable to a Participant     or for a Participant s     benefit under this Supplemental Plan may not be reduced by, or offset against, any amount owing by a Participant     to the Company or any of its affiliates. 
  (c)  Employment rights shall not be enlarged or affected hereby.  The Company shall continue to have the right to discharge or retire a Participant, with or without cause. 
           8. 
    Miscellaneous 
     (a)  Timken shall, in its discretion, interpret where necessary, in its reasonable and good faith judgment, the provisions of the Supplemental Plan and, except as otherwise provided in the Supplemental Plan, shall determine the rights and status of Participants, Spouses and other beneficiaries hereunder (including, without limitation, the amount of any benefit to which a Participant or beneficiary may be entitled under the Supplemental Plan).  Except to the extent federal law controls, all questions pertaining to the construction, validity, and effect of the provisions hereof shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio. 
  (b)  Timken may, from time to time, delegate all or part of the administrative powers, duties, and authorities delegated to it under the Supplemental Plan to such person or persons, office or committee as it shall select.  For the purposes of ERISA, Timken shall be the Supplemental Plan sponsor and the Plan Administrator. 
  (c)  Whenever there is denied, whether in whole or in part, a claim for benefits under the Supplemental Plan filed by any person (herein referred to as the  Claimant ), the Plan Administrator shall transmit a written notice of such decision to the Claimant within 90 days of receiving the claim from the Claimant, which notice shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant and shall contain a statement of the specific reasons for the denial of the claim, a reference to the relevant Supplemental Plan provisions, a description and explanation of additional information needed, and a statement advising the Claimant that, within 60 days of the date on which he or she receives such notice, he or she may obtain review of such decision in accordance with the procedures hereinafter set forth.  Within such 60-day period, the Claimant or the Claimant s authorized representative may request that the claim denial be reviewed by filing  

with the Plan Administrator a written request therefor, which request shall contain the following information: 
           (i) 
    the date on which the Claimant s request was filed with the Plan Administrator; provided, however, that the date on which the Claimant s request for review was in fact filed with Plan Administrator shall control in the event that the date of the actual filing is later than the date stated by the Claimant pursuant to this paragraph; 
              (ii) 
    the specific portions of the denial of the claim which the Claimant requests the Plan Administrator to review; 
              (iii) 
    a statement by the Claimant setting forth the basis upon which the Claimant believes the Plan Administrator should reverse the previous denial of the Claimant s claim for benefits and accept the claim as made; and 
              (iv) 
    any written material (offered as exhibits) which the Claimant desires the Plan Administrator to examine in its consideration of the Claimant s position as stated pursuant to clause (iii) above.   
     Within 60 days of the date determined pursuant to clause (i) above, the Plan Administrator shall conduct a full and fair review of the decision denying the Claimant s claim for benefits. Within 60 days of the date of such hearing, the Plan Administrator shall render its written decision on review, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant and including the reasons and Plan provisions upon which its decision was based, a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents and other information relevant to the claim, and a statement describing the Claimant s right to bring an action under Section 502(a) of ERISA. 
  (d)  The Company may withhold from a payment any federal (including employment taxes), state or local taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such payments and such sums as the Company may reasonably estimate as necessary to cover any taxes for which the Company may be liable and which may be assessed with regard to such payment.  
           9. 
    Amendment and Termination 
     (a)  Timken has reserved and does hereby reserve the right to amend, restate or terminate, at any time, any or all of the provisions of the Supplemental Plan, without the consent of any Participant, Spouse, beneficiary, or any other person.  Without limiting the authority of the Board of Directors of Timken or a duly authorized committee thereof to amend, restate or terminate the Supplemental Plan, the Board of Directors of Timken has authorized and instructed its Executive Vice President - Human Resources (or any other officer or delegate of an officer) to amend, restate or terminate the Plan.  Any amendment, restatement or termination of the Plan shall be expressed in an instrument executed in the name of Timken.  Any such amendment, restatement or termination shall become effective as of the date designated in such instrument or, if no such date is specified, on the date of its execution. 
  (b)  Notwithstanding paragraph 9(a) hereof, no amendment, restatement or termination of the Supplemental Plan shall, without the consent of the Participant (or, in the case of his or her death, his or her beneficiary or Spouse, as applicable), adversely affect (i) the benefit under the Supplemental Plan of any Participant, Spouse or beneficiary then entitled to receive a benefit under the Supplemental Plan or (ii) the right of any Participant to receive upon termination of employment with the Company (or the right of the Participant s Spouse or other beneficiary, as applicable, to receive upon the Participant s death) that benefit which would have been received under the Supplemental Plan if such employment of the Participant had terminated immediately prior to the amendment, restatement or termination of the Supplemental Plan; provided, however, that the consent requirement of Participants, Spouses or other beneficiaries to certain actions shall not apply to any amendment or termination made by the Company pursuant to paragraph 11(b).  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, Timken, in its sole discretion, may terminate this  

Supplemental Plan in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix), or any successor provision.   
           10. 
    Restriction on Competition 
     For a period of two years following a Participant s separation from service, the Participant shall not (a) engage or participate, directly or indirectly, in any Competitive Activity (as defined below), or (b) solicit or cause to be solicited on behalf of a competitor any person or entity which was a customer of the Company during the three year period ending on the Participant s retirement date, if the Participant had any direct responsibility for such customer while employed by the Company.  The term  Competitive Activity  shall mean the Participant s participation, without the written consent of an officer of the Company, in the management of any business enterprise if such enterprise engages in substantial and direct competition with the Company and such enterprise s sales of any product or service competitive with any product or service of the Company amounted to 25% of such enterprise s net sales for its most recently completed fiscal year and if the Company s net sales of said product or service amounted to 25% of the Company s net sales for its most recently completed fiscal year.   Competitive Activity  shall not include (y) the mere ownership of securities in any enterprise and exercise of rights appurtenant thereto or (z) participation in management of any enterprise or business operation thereof other than in connection with the competitive operation of such enterprise.  If a Participant engages in activity prohibited by this paragraph, then in addition to all other remedies available to the Company, the Company shall be released of any obligation under the Supplemental Plan to pay benefits to such Participant or to such Participant s Spouse or beneficiary under the Supplemental Plan. 
   (a)  To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Supplemental Plan (including all amendments thereto) comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, so that the income inclusion provisions of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code do not apply to the     Participant, Spouse or a beneficiary.  This Supplemental Plan shall be administered in a manner consistent with this intent.  
  (b)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Supplemental Plan to the contrary, in light of the uncertainty with respect to the proper application of Section 409A of the Code, Timken reserves the right to make amendments to this Supplemental Plan as Timken deems necessary or desirable to avoid the imposition of taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code.  In any case, a Participant shall be solely responsible and liable for the satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that may be imposed on a Participant or for a Participant s account in connection with this Supplemental Plan (including any taxes and penalties under Section 409A of the Code), and neither the Company nor any of its affiliates shall have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise hold a Participant harmless from any or all of such taxes or penalties.  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, The Company has executed this amendment and restatement of this Supplemental Plan at North Canton, Ohio, this ____ day of __________, 2018.
