NOTE
1       Basis of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of Socket Mobile, Inc. (the  Company ) have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions
to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring accruals considered necessary for fair presentation have been included. The
results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year
or any future period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes
included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  

NOTE
2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Use
of Estimates   

  The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements.  

Cash
Equivalents and Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

  The
Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity date of 90 days or less at date of purchase to be cash
equivalents. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, all of the Company s cash and cash equivalents consisted of amounts
held in demand deposit accounts in banks. The aggregate cash balance on deposit in these accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. The Company s cash balance on deposit in these accounts may, at times, exceed the
federally insured limits. The Company has never experienced any losses in such accounts.  

The
carrying value of the Company s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, debt and foreign exchange
contracts approximate fair value due to the relatively short period of time to maturity.  

Revenue
Recognition and Deferred Revenue   

  On
January 1, 2017, the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09 (now ASC 606  Revenue from Contracts with Customers ) and implemented
a new revenue recognition policy. Instead of deferring 100% of revenue and cost of revenue until products are sold by distributors,
under the new policy, we recognized revenue on sales to distributors when shipping of product is completed and title transfers
to the distributor, less a reserve for estimated product returns (sales and cost of sales). The reserves are based on estimates
of future returns calculated from actual return history plus knowledge of pending returns outside of the norm. Actual return history
is approximately 17% of the channel inventory, primarily from stock rotations. On January 1, 2017, the Company recorded a one-time
reduction (debit) to net deferred revenue in the amount of $836,000 less the deferred tax effects of $333,000 for a net improvement
in retained deficit of $503,000. At June 30, 2018, the deferred revenue and deferred cost on shipments to distributors were approximately
$441,000 and $181,000 respectively, compared to approximately $493,000 and $204,000, respectively, at December 31, 2017.

NOTE
5   Bank Financing Arrangements   

On
January 31, 2018, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Business Financing Agreement (the  Third Financing Agreement )
with Western Alliance Bank (the  Bank), that provides for a $2.5 million revolving line of credit and a $4.0 million term
loan that the Company may use to repurchase shares of common stock. Pursuant to the revolving line of credit, the Company is permitted
to borrow up to the lesser of $2.5 million or 80% of eligible accounts receivables. Amounts outstanding under the line of credit
bear interest at the  U.S. Prime Rate  published by the Wall Street Journal plus 0.75%. Interest is payable monthly
on the line of credit, and the principal is due upon the maturity date of January 31, 2020. Amounts outstanding under the term
loan bear interest at the  U.S. Prime Rate  published by the Wall Street Journal plus 1.75%. Following a three-month
interest only period, the term loan is payable in 45 equal monthly installments of principal and interest. The loans are secured
by all of the Company s present and future assets, including intellectual property and general intangibles. Termination
of the revolving line of credit or term loan prior to its termination date may be subject to early termination fees, subject to
certain exceptions. Amounts repaid or prepaid under the term loan may not be reborrowed. At the end of each quarter through the
quarter ending December 31, 2018, the Company is required to prepay outstanding term loan principal in an amount equal to 25%
of excess cash flow, as set forth in the Third Financing Agreement, for the most recent quarter ended. The Company is also obligated
to pay customary fees for a loan facility of this size and type.

The
Third Financing Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the
Company s ability to, among other things, grant liens, make investments, incur indebtedness, merge or consolidate, dispose
of assets, make acquisitions, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock, enter into transactions with affiliates and
enter into restrictive agreements, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type. The
Company is also required to maintain compliance with an asset coverage ratio measured monthly, which requirements increase during
the term of the Financing Agreement, a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.75 to 1.0, measured quarterly, and a total
funded debt to trailing twelve months EBITDA multiple of not more than 1.75 to 1.0, measured monthly.  

The
Third Financing Agreement also contains customary events of default including, among others, payment defaults, breaches of covenants,
bankruptcy and insolvency events, cross defaults with certain material indebtedness, judgment defaults, and breaches of representations
and warranties. Upon an event of default, the Bank may declare all or a portion of the Company s outstanding obligations
payable to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights and remedies provided for under the Financing Agreement. During
the existence of an event of default, interest on the obligations could be increased.  

On
March 1, 2018, the Company received proceeds of $4.0 million under the provisions of the term loan for a common stock repurchase.
On March 9, 2018, the Company completed a tender offer to purchase and retire 1,250,000 shares of common stock from multiple investors
at a purchase price of $3.90 per share, for an aggregate cost of approximately $4.9 million, excluding fees and expenses relating
to the tender offer.  

On
April 12, 2018, the Company advised the Bank that its operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were not expected
to be in compliance with two financial covenants, the first a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and the second a Total Funded Debt to
EBITDA ratio. The Company reported the non-compliance in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Bank verbally
agreed to forbear the events of default subject to further modification of the Financing Agreement. The Company subsequently paid
down the term loan from $4.0 million at March 31, 2018 to $1.0 million at June 30, 2018. The paydowns were made from its cash
and revolving lines of credit.

On
June 4, 2018, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Business Financing Agreement (the  Fourth Financing Agreement )
with the Bank. In the Fourth Financing Agreement, the Bank recognizes the repayment of the outstanding term loan balance to $1.0
million by June 30, 2018. The remaining balance is repayable in 24 equal monthly installments. The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
is replaced with a commitment to maintain cash plus available credit at or above the term loan balance. The Total Funded Debt
to EBITDA ratio and the excess cash flow application provisions that were designed to accelerate the pay down of the term loan
balance are removed. The Bank permanently waived the defaults resulting from March 31, 2018 results when pay down of the term
loan balance to $1.0 million by June 30, 2018 was achieved. In the Fourth Financing Agreement, the Company is required to maintain
compliance with the Asset Coverage Ratio measured monthly. The required Asset Coverage Ratio at June 30, 2018 was 1.0 to 1.0.  

On
July 30, 2018, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Business Financing Agreement (the  Fifth Financing Agreement )

Concentration
of Suppliers   

  Several
of the Company s component parts are produced by a sole or limited number of suppliers. Shortages could occur in these essential
materials due to increased demand, or to an interruption of supply. Suppliers may choose to restrict credit terms or require advance
payments causing delays in the procurement of essential materials. If the Company were unable to procure certain of such materials,
it could have a material adverse effect upon its results. At June 30, 2018, 27% of the Company s accounts payable balances
was concentrated in the top two suppliers. For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the top two suppliers accounted for 46% of
the inventory purchases.  

NOTE
7   Stock-Based Compensation   

The
Company recognizes the compensation cost in the financial statements for all stock-based awards to employees, including grants
of employee stock options, based on the fair value of the awards as of the date that the awards are issued. The fair values of
stock options are generally determined using a binomial lattice valuation model that incorporates assumptions about expected volatility,
risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, and expected life. Compensation cost for stock-based awards is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period. Total stock-based compensation expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, was $118,843
and $230,976, respectively. Total stock-based compensation expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, was $107,389
and $203,086, respectively. In the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, 259,700 stock options were granted at a weighted
average per share fair value estimated at $1.65.

The
Company  

We
are a leading producer of data capture products for mobile applications used in Retail, Commercial Services, Industrial  
Manufacturing, Transportation   Logistics, and Health Care. Our primary products are cordless data capture devices that connect
over Bluetooth and work with applications running on smartphones, tablets and mobile computers using operating systems from Apple 
(iOS), Google  (Android ) and Microsoft  (Windows ). We focus on serving the needs of software application
developers as scanner sales are primarily driven by the deployment of barcode and NFC/RFID enabled mobile applications.  

We
design our own products and subcontract the manufacturing of product components to independent third-party contract manufacturers
who are located in the U.S., Mexico, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Taiwan and who have the equipment, know-how and capacity
to manufacture products to our specifications. Final products are assembled, tested, packaged, and distributed at and from our
Newark, California facility. We offer the products worldwide through two-tier distribution enabling customers to purchase from
a large number of on-line resellers around the world including some application developers. The geographic regions that we serve
include the Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa.  

We
believe growth in mobile applications and the mobile workforce are resulting from technical advances in mobile technologies, cost
reductions in mobile devices and the growing adoption by businesses of mobile applications running on smartphones and tablets,
building a growing demand for our products. Our data capture products address the growing need for speed and accuracy by today s
mobile workers and by the systems supporting those workers, thereby enhancing their productivity and allowing them to exploit
time sensitive opportunities and improve customer satisfaction.  

Products   

Cordless
barcode scanners   

  We
offer a full range of handheld cordless barcode scanners connecting to smartphones, tablets and other computing devices over Bluetooth.
Our 7 Series standard barcode scanners are lightweight and ergonomically designed for easy handling as stand-alone cordless barcode
scanners. The 7 Series scanners come in six vivid colors, blue, gray, green, red, white and yellow. In April 2018, we introduced
our SocketScan  700 Series colorful barcode scanners that will eventually replace the 7 Series. The SocketScan 700 Series
come in three modules: linear imager (S700), laser (S730) and 2D imager (S740) in five vivid colors: blue, green, red, white and
yellow. Our DuraScan  line of durable barcode scanners come in four models: linear imager (D700), laser (D730) and 2D imager
(D740 and D750). Using the same ergonomic form factor, these barcode scanners have an IP54 durability rating and improved usability
features in industrial colors: Construction Orange, Safety Green and Utility Gray. Our SocketScan 800 Series cordless barcode
scanners in linear imaging (S800) and 2D models (S850) are designed to be attachable, with an easily detachable clip, to smartphones
and other mobile devices for more integrated barcode scanning. The 800 Series scanners can also be used in simple handheld mode.
Our 800 Series sleeve solution,  DuraCase , is designed to keep an iPod or smartphone and barcode scanner together
and enable both devices to be used and charged simultaneously and easily operated with a single hand.

Contactless
RFID/NFC Reader/Writer   

  Our
Contactless RFID/NFC Reader/Writer version of durable handheld scanner, D600, can read and write many different types of electronic
SmartTags. SmartTags are used in many applications today, like digital wallet applications for loyalty cards, identification cards,
payment cards, coupons, event tickets and others which leverage the exchange of electronic  tokens . We are working
with our registered application developers to encourage them to include Near Field Communications capabilities in their mobile
applications. We are an early entrant into this market and do not face significant head to head competition from alternative reader/writer
devices.  

Software
Developer Kit (Capture SDK)   

  Our
Software Developer Kit (Capture SDK) supports all of our data capture devices (both barcode reader and RFID/NFC Reader/Writer)
with a single installation, making it easy for registered third-party application developers to integrate our data capture capabilities
into their application centric solution while giving the customers the ability to select the products that work best for them.
Our Capture SDK enables the developers to modify the placement of the captured data in their application and control the feedback
to the users that the transaction and transmission was successfully completed. The Capture SDK also enables the built-in camera
in a customer s smartphone or tablet to be used for occasional or lower volume data collection requirements. In April 2018,
we introduced a new Capture SDK which has been restructured to better support our existing iOS and Android developers by enabling
them to develop in their preferred development environments and make it easier and quicker to integrate scanner support. The Capture
SDK enables us to support many development environments that corporate developers prefer.

replacement due to accidental breakage. We also repair or replace products that are beyond their warranty period.  

Revenues   

Total
revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were $4.2 million and $8.2 million, respectively, a decrease of 28%
from revenues of $5.8 million and $11.4 million, respectively, in the comparable periods one year ago. Our product revenues and
the corresponding decrease and increase in revenues for the comparable periods are shown in the following table:  

Index   

Revenue
of our  cordless barcode scanners and accessories  was $4.14 million or 99% of our overall revenues for the second quarter
of 2018, a decrease of 27% or $1.55 million compared to the revenue of $5.69 million for the second quarter of 2017. Revenue for
the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $8.0 million, a decrease of 29% or $3.2 million compared to the revenue of $11.2 million
in the same period a year ago. Lower revenue for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 is primarily due to a lack
of enterprise deployments during 2018. Revenue in 2017 included large shipments of cordless barcode scanner orders to two customers
of $0.7 million and $1.9 million for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2017, respectively, whereas shipments in the
first half of 2018 were primarily fulfilling smaller unit orders. Lower revenue in 2018 is also due to delays in shipping of our
new SocketScan products. At the beginning of the year, we announced our expectation to launch our newest product line, SocketScan
series in mid-Q1 but the actual shipments commenced in late April due to some technical issues. With the delivery of our new products,
our developers have started their qualification of the new products, which may take several months to evaluate and recommend our
new products.  

Service
 comprised 1% of revenue for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. Our SocketCare service contracts
are purchased by our customers in conjunction with the purchase of cordless barcode scanners. Due to the robustness and lower
cost of the data capture products, service revenue continues to be a small portion of the total revenue.  

Gross
Margins  

Our
gross margins on sales for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 were 50.9% and 51.3%, respectively, compared to
53.6% and 52.7%, respectively, for the corresponding periods a year ago. The lower margins in 2018 reflected absorption of fixed
manufacturing costs over a smaller number of units sold. Q2 2018 gross margins were also impacted by the higher costs associated
with expedited production of the first 1,200 units of the new SocketScan products shipped in April and May.  

Research
and Development Expense   

Research
and development expense in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 were $917,000 and $1,864,000, an increase of 7% and 13%
compared to expenses of $859,000 and $1,656,000 in the corresponding periods a year ago. Increase in the level of research and
development expense was primarily due to higher personnel costs reflecting headcount additions to facilitate product development
and meet more complex requirements of today s products. We expect research and development expense to remain flat for the
remainder of the year.  

Sales
and Marketing Expense   

Sales
and marketing expense in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were $734,000 and $1,472,000, a decrease of 1% and 2% compared
to the expense of $742,000 and $1,501,000 in the corresponding periods a year ago. Sales and marketing expense for the second
half of 2018 is expected to remain flat.  

Index   

General
and Administrative Expense   

General
and administrative expense in the second quarter of 2018 was $625,000, an increase of 4% compared to expense of $601,000 in Q2
2017. Expense in the six-month period of both 2018 and 2017 was at the same level, $1.29 million. General and administrative expense
is expected to decline slightly for the balance of 2018.  

Interest
Expense, Net of Interest Income   

Interest
expense, net of interest income, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was $47,981 and $67,900, respectively, compared
to $30,678 and $60,354, respectively, in the same periods one year ago. Interest expense in 2018 was primarily related to interest
on bank term loan and credit line facilities (see  NOTE 5   Bank Financing Arrangements  for more information).
Average outstanding balance of bank term loan and credit lines during the first six months of 2018 was $2.75 million. Interest
expense in 2017 was primarily related to interest on subordinated convertible notes payable issued in 2012 and reissued in September
of 2013 (see  NOTE 4   Short-Term Related Party Convertible Notes Payable  for more information). Additionally,
interest expense in each of the comparable first quarters includes interest on equipment lease financing obligations.  

Interest
income reflects interest earned on cash balances. Interest income was nominal in each of the comparable first quarters, reflecting
low average cash balances combined with low average rates of return.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, effective on January 1, 2018, eliminates alternative minimum taxes and lowers the U.S. federal
corporate income tax from 34% to 21%. On December 31, 2017, we remeasured the net deferred tax assets and posted a one-time reduction
of $2.6 million in deferred tax assets to reflect the lower realization rate to be applied commencing in 2018.  

In
the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded deferred tax benefits of $53,707 and $133,634, respectively, based on
an expectation of at least a breakeven in our full year s results. In the same period one year ago, we recorded income tax
expenses of $387,437 and $639,988, respectively. Our deferred tax asset, primarily representing future income tax savings from
the application of net operating loss carry forwards, was valued at $5,771,000 at June 30, 2018.  

We
have determined that utilization of existing net operating losses against future taxable income is not limited by Section 382
of the Internal Revenue Code. Future ownership changes, however, may limit our ability to fully utilize the existing net operating
loss carryforwards against any future taxable income.  

Index   

Cash
Flows and Contractual Obligations   

As
reflected in our Statements of Cash Flows, net cash provided by operating activities was $409,000 in the first half of 2018, compared
to net cash provided by operating activities of $702,000 in the comparable period a year ago. We calculate net cash provided by
operating activities by decreasing our net loss ($363,000 in the first half of 2018) or increasing our net income ($876,000 in
the first half of 2017) by the expenses, such as stock based compensation expense, depreciation, and deferred tax expense, that
did not require the use of cash. These amounts totaled $295,000 and $976,000 in the first half of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
In addition, we report increases in assets and reductions in liabilities as uses of cash and decreases in assets and increases
in liabilities as sources of cash, together referred to as changes in operating assets and liabilities. In the first half of 2018,
changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net source of cash of $477,000 and were primarily from reductions in
accounts receivables due to lower overall shipments to our distributors in the first half of 2018, increases in accounts payables
due to the timing of vendor payments, and partially offset by the decreases of accrued liabilities. In the first six months of
2017, changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net use of cash of $1,149,000 which was primarily due to the buildup
of inventories to accommodate rising sales, increases in accounts receivable driven by the higher shipments in the second half
of Q2 2017, prepayments for insurance policies and operating leases, and increases in capitalized software development costs for
our new product D600.  

In
the first half of 2018 and 2017, we invested $270,000 and $88,000, respectively, in manufacturing tooling costs and computer software
development costs.  

Net
cash used in financing activities was $2.2 million in the first half of 2018, compared to net cash provided of $201,000 in the
comparable period a year ago. Financing activities in the first half of 2018 consisted primarily of the $5.0 million use of cash
related to repurchase of company stock, partially offset by net $1.0 million borrowed on our term loan, net $1.5 million borrowed
on our bank lines of credit, and $279,000 proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Financing activities in the first quarter
of 2017 consisted primarily of the proceeds from the exercise of stock options.  

Our
contractual cash obligations at June 30, 2018 are outlined in the table below:  

Index   

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

As
of June 30, 2018, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

Interest
Rate Risk   

Our
exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our bank term loan and credit line facilities. Amounts
outstanding under the term loan bear interest at lender's prime rate (minimum of 4.25%) plus 1.75%. Our bank credit line facilities
of up to $2.5 million have variable interest rates based upon the lender's prime rate (minimum of 4.25%) plus 0.75%, for both
the domestic line (up to $2.0 million) and the international line (up to $0.5 million). Accordingly, interest rate increases could
increase our interest expense on outstanding term loan and credit line balances. Based on a sensitivity analysis during the three
months ended June 30, 2018, an increase of 1% in the interest rate would have increased our second quarter borrowing costs by
approximately $7,000.  

Foreign
Currency Risk  

A
substantial majority of our revenue, expense and purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, we require our
European distributors to purchase our products in Euros and we pay the expenses of our European employees in Euros and British
pounds. We may enter into selected future purchase commitments with foreign suppliers that may be paid in the local currency of
the supplier. We hedge a significant portion of our European receivables balance denominated in Euros to reduce the foreign currency
risk associated with these assets, and we have not been subject to significant losses from material foreign currency fluctuations.
Based on a sensitivity analysis of our net foreign currency denominated assets and expenses at the beginning, during and at the
end of the quarter ended June 30, 2018, an adverse change of 10% in exchange rates would have resulted in an decrease in our net
income for the second quarter of 2018 of approximately $42,600 if left unprotected. For the second quarter of 2018, the total
net adjustment for the effects of changes in foreign currency on cash balances, collections, payables, and derivatives used to
hedge foreign currency risks, was a net loss of $12,700. We will continue to monitor, assess, and mitigate through hedging activities,
our risks related to foreign currency fluctuations.

4. Controls and Procedures   

Conclusion
Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

  Our
management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on
this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission
rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

  There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by the last fiscal quarter
ended June 30, 2017 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

Index   

PART
II   

Item
1A. Risk Factors   

The
risks described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties
not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and operating results.   

We
may not maintain ongoing profitability.   

We
have been unprofitable in the past two quarters. To maintain ongoing profitability, we must accomplish numerous objectives, including
continued growth in our business, ongoing support to registered developers whose applications support the use of our data capture
products, and the development of successful new products. We cannot foresee with any certainty whether we will be able to achieve
these objectives in the future. Accordingly, we may not generate sufficient net revenue or manage our expenses sufficiently to
maintain ongoing profitability. If we cannot maintain ongoing profitability, we will not be able to support our operations from
positive cash flows, and we would use our existing cash to support operating losses. If we are unable to secure the necessary
capital to replace that cash, we may need to suspend some or all of our current operations.  

We
may require additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, or on terms
that would not cause substantial dilution to investors  stock holdings.   

We
may need to raise capital to fund our growth or operating losses in future periods. Our forecasts are highly dependent on factors
beyond our control, including market acceptance of our products and delays in deployments by businesses of applications that use
our data capture products. Even if we maintain profitable operating levels, we may need to raise capital to provide sufficient
working capital to fund our growth. If capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned, we may require additional
capital sooner than expected. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms
acceptable to us, if at all.  

If
application developers are not successful in their efforts to develop, market and sell their applications into which our software
and products are incorporated, we may not achieve our sales projections.   

We
are dependent upon application developers to integrate our scanning and software products into their applications designed for
mobile workers using smartphones, tablets and mobile computers, and to successfully market and sell those application products
and solutions into the marketplace. We focus on serving the needs of application developers as sales of our data capture products
are application driven. However, these developers may take considerable time to complete development of their applications, may
experience delays in their development timelines, may develop competing applications, may be unsuccessful in marketing and selling
their application products and solutions to customers, or may experience delays in customer deployments and implementations, which
would adversely affect our ability to achieve our revenue projections.  

Index   

Failure
to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price.   

We
have evaluated and will continue to evaluate our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires an annual management assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented
or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal
control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls,
particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important
to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or detect and prevent fraud, our business
and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading
price of our stock could drop significantly.  

Despite
security protections, our business records and information systems could be hacked by unauthorized personnel   

We
protect our business records and information from access by unauthorized personnel. We maintain adequate segregation of duties
in safeguarding our assets and related records and monitor our systems to detect any attempts to bypass our controls and procedures
which we evaluate and update from time to time. We are aware that unauthorized efforts to access our business records and information
with sophisticated tools could bypass our controls and procedures and we remain alert to that possibility.  

Global
economic conditions may have a negative impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict,
and may further limit our ability to raise additional funds.   

Global
economic conditions may have an impact on our business and our financial condition. We may face significant challenges if global
economic growth slows down and conditions in the financial markets worsen. In particular, should these conditions cause our revenues
to be materially less than forecast, we may find it necessary to initiate reductions in our expenses and defer product development
programs. In addition, our ability to access the capital markets and raise funds required for our operations may be severely restricted
at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our current and future
funding requirements and on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  

Index   

Our
quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which could cause our stock price to decline.   

We
expect to experience quarterly fluctuations in operating results in the future. We generally ship orders as received, and as a
result we may have little backlog. Quarterly revenues and operating results therefore depend on the volume and timing of orders
received during the quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Historically, we have often recognized a substantial portion of
our revenue in the last month of the quarter. This subjects us to the risk that even modest delays in orders or in the manufacture
of products relating to orders received, may adversely affect our quarterly operating results. Our operating results may also
fluctuate due to factors such as:  

the
                                         demand for our products;    

the
                                         size and timing of customer orders;    

unanticipated
                                         delays or problems in our introduction of new products and product enhancements;    

the
                                         introduction of new products and product enhancements by our competitors;    

the
                                         timing of the introduction and deployments of new applications that work with our products;    

changes
                                         in the revenues attributable to royalties and engineering development services;    

product
                                         mix;    

timing
                                         of software enhancements;    

changes
                                         in the level of operating expenses;    

competitive
                                         conditions in the industry including competitive pressures resulting in lower average
                                         selling prices;    

timing
                                         of distributors  shipments to their customers;    

delays
                                         in supplies of key components used in the manufacturing of our products, and     

general
                                         economic conditions and conditions specific to our customers  industries.    

Because
we base our staffing and other operating expenses on anticipated revenues, unanticipated declines or delays in the receipt of
orders can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter. As a result of any of the foregoing factors,
or a combination, our results of operations in any given quarter may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors,
in which case the market price of our common stock would be adversely affected.  

To
maintain the availability of our bank lines of credit we must remain in compliance with the covenants as specified under the terms
of the credit agreements and the bank may exercise discretion in making advances to us.   

Our
credit agreements with our bank requires us to maintain compliance with an asset coverage ratio measured monthly, which requirements
increase during the term of the financing agreement. The agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including
covenants that limit or restrict our ability to, among other things, grant liens, make investments, incur indebtedness, merge
or consolidate, dispose of assets, make acquisitions, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock, enter into transactions
with affiliates and enter into restrictive agreements, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this
size and type. The agreement also contains customary events of default including, among others, payment defaults, breaches of
covenants, bankruptcy and insolvency events, cross defaults with certain material indebtedness, judgment defaults, and breaches
of representations and warranties. Upon an event of default, our bank may declare all or a portion of our outstanding obligations
payable to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights and remedies provided for under the agreement. During the
existence of an event of default, interest on the obligations could be increased. The agreement may be terminated by us or by
our bank at any time. Upon such termination, our bank would no longer make advances under the credit agreement and outstanding
advances would be repaid as receivables are collected. All advances are at our bank s discretion and our bank is not obligated
to make advances.  

Index   

Deferred
tax assets comprise a significant portion of our assets and are dependent upon future tax profitability to realize the benefits.   

We
have recorded deferred tax assets on our balance sheet because we believe that it is more likely than not that we will generate
sufficient tax profitability in the future to realize the tax savings our deferred tax assets represent. If we do not achieve
and maintain sufficient profitability, the tax savings represented by our deferred tax assets may never be realized and we would
need to recognize a loss for those deferred tax assets.  

Goodwill
comprises a significant portion of our assets and may be subject to impairment write-downs in future periods which would substantially
increase our losses, make it more difficult to achieve profitability, and could cause our stock price to decline.   

We
review our goodwill for impairment at least annually as of September 30th, and more often if factors suggest potential impairment.
Many factors are considered in evaluating goodwill including our market capitalization, comparable companies within our industry,
our estimates of our future performance, and discounted cash flow analysis. Many of these factors are highly subjective and may
be negatively impacted by our financial results and market conditions in the future. We may incur goodwill impairment charges
in the future and any future write-downs of our goodwill would adversely affect our operating results, make it more difficult
to maintain profitability, and as a result the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.  

We
may be unable to manufacture our products because we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers for our components.   

Several
of our component parts are produced by one or a limited number of suppliers. Shortages or delays could occur in these essential
components due to an interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. Suppliers may choose to restrict credit terms
or require advance payment causing delays in the procurement of essential materials. If we are unable to procure certain component
parts, we could be required to reduce our operations while we seek alternative sources for these components, which could have
a material adverse effect on our financial results. To the extent that we acquire extra inventory stocks to protect against possible
shortages, we would be exposed to additional risks associated with holding inventory, such as obsolescence, excess quantities,
or loss.  

If
we fail to develop and introduce new products rapidly and successfully, we will not be able to compete effectively, and our ability
to generate sufficient revenues will be negatively affected.   

The
market for our products is prone to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and short product life cycles. If
we are unsuccessful at developing and introducing new products and services on a timely basis that include the latest technologies
conform to the newest standards and that are appealing to end users, we will not be able to compete effectively, and our ability
to generate significant revenues will be seriously harmed.  

Index   

The
development of new products and services can be very difficult and requires high levels of innovation. The development process
is also lengthy and costly. Short product life cycles for smartphones and tablets expose our products to the risk of obsolescence
and require frequent new product upgrades and introductions. We will be unable to introduce new products and services into the
market on a timely basis and compete successfully, if we fail to:  

invest
                                         significant resources in research and development, sales and marketing, and customer
                                         support;    

identify
                                         emerging trends, demands and standards in the field of mobile computing products;    

enhance
                                         our products by adding additional features;     

maintain

anticipate
                                         our end users  needs and technological trends accurately.    

We
cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to make adequate investments in research and development or that we will
be able to identify trends or make the technological advances necessary to be competitive.  

A
significant portion of our revenue currently comes from a limited number of distributors, and any decrease in revenue from these
distributors could harm our business.   

A
significant portion of our revenue comes from a limited number of distributors. In the first half year of 2018 and 2017, Ingram
Micro Inc., ScanSource ,  Inc., and BlueStar, Inc. together represented approximately 64% and 75%, respectively, of our worldwide
revenues. We expect that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to depend on sales to a limited number of distributors.
We do not have long-term commitments from our distributors to carry our products, and any of our distributors may from quarter
to quarter comprise a significant concentration of our revenues. Any could choose to stop selling some or all of our products
at any time, and each of these companies also carries our competitors  products. If we lose our relationship with any of
our significant distributors, we would experience disruption and delays in marketing our products.  

We
may not be able to collect receivables from customers who experience financial difficulties .  

Our
accounts receivables are derived primarily from distributors. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers  financial
conditions but generally require no collateral from our customers. Reserves are maintained for potential credit losses, and such
losses have historically been within such reserves. However, many of our customers may be thinly capitalized and may be prone
to failure in adverse market conditions. Although our collection history has been good, from time to time a customer may not pay
us because of financial difficulty, bankruptcy or liquidation. If global financial conditions have an impact on our customers 
ability to pay us in a timely manner, and consequently, we may experience increased difficulty in collecting our accounts receivable,
and we may have to increase our reserves in anticipation of increased uncollectible accounts.  

Index   

We
could face increased competition in the future, which would adversely affect our financial performance.   

The
market in which we operate is very competitive. Our future financial performance is contingent on a number of unpredictable factors,
including that:  

some
                                         of our competitors have greater financial, marketing, and technical resources than we
                                         do;     

we
                                         periodically face intense price competition, particularly when our competitors have excess
                                         inventories and discount their prices to clear their inventories; and    

certain
                                         manufacturers of tablets and mobile phones offer products with built-in functions, such
                                         as Bluetooth wireless technology or barcode scanning, that compete with our products.

Increased
competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins, and loss of market share. Our failure to
compete successfully against current or future competitors could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.  

If
we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, our operating results will suffer.   

The
demand for our products depends on many factors and is difficult to forecast as we introduce and support more products, and as
competition in the markets for our products intensifies. If demand is lower than forecasted levels, we could have excess production
resulting in higher inventories of finished products and components, which could lead to write-downs or write-offs of some or
all of the excess inventories, and reductions in our cash balances. Lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing
capacity at our third-party manufacturers and in our failure to meet minimum purchase commitments, each of which may lower our
operating results.  

If
demand increases beyond forecasted levels, we would have to rapidly increase production at our third-party manufacturers. We depend
on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components, and suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough
to meet unexpected demand. Even if we were able to procure enough components, our third-party manufacturers might not be able
to produce enough of our devices to meet our customer demand. In addition, rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated
demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses. These higher costs could lower
our profit margins. Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing yields could decline, which may also lower operating
results.  

We
rely primarily on distributors to sell our products, and our sales would suffer if any of these distributors stops selling our
products effectively.   

Because
we sell our products primarily through distributors, we are subject to risks associated with channel distribution, such as risks
related to their inventory levels and support for our products. Our distribution channels may build up inventories in anticipation
of growth in their sales. If such growth in their sales does not occur as anticipated, the inventory build-up could contribute
to higher levels of product returns. The lack of sales by any one significant participant in our distribution channels could result
in excess inventories and adversely affect our operating results and working capital liquidity.  

Index   

Our
agreements with distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated on short notice by them without cause. Our distributors
are not within our control, are not obligated to purchase products from us, and may offer competitive lines of products simultaneously.
Sales growth is contingent in part on our ability to enter into additional distribution relationships and expand our sales channels.
We cannot predict whether we will be successful in establishing new distribution relationships, expanding our sales channels or
maintaining our existing relationships. A failure to enter into new distribution relationships or to expand our sales channels
could adversely impact our ability to grow our sales.  

We
allow our distribution channels to return a portion of their inventory to us for full credit against other purchases. In addition,
in the event we reduce our prices, we credit our distributors for the difference between the purchase price of products remaining
in their inventory and our reduced price for such products. Actual returns and price protection may adversely affect future operating
results and working capital liquidity by reducing our accounts receivable and increasing our inventory balances, particularly
since we seek to continually introduce new and enhanced products and are likely to face increasing price competition.  

We
depend on alliances and other business relationships with third-parties, and a disruption in these relationships would hinder
our ability to develop and sell our products.   

We
depend on strategic alliances and business relationships with leading participants in various segments of the mobile applications
market to help us develop and market our products. Our strategic partners may revoke their commitment to our products or services
at any time in the future or may develop their own competitive products or services. Accordingly, our strategic relationships
may not result in sustained business alliances, successful product or service offerings, or the generation of significant revenues.
Failure of one or more of such alliances could result in delay or termination of product development projects, failure to win
new customers, or loss of confidence by current or potential customers.  

We
have devoted significant research and development resources to design products to work with a number of operating systems used
in mobile devices including Apple (iOS), Google (Android), and Microsoft (Windows/Windows Mobile). Such design activities have
diverted financial and personnel resources from other development projects. These design activities are not undertaken pursuant
to any agreement under which Apple, Google or Microsoft is obligated to collaborate or to support the products produced from such
collaboration. Consequently, these organizations may terminate their collaborations with us for a variety of reasons, including
our failure to meet agreed-upon standards or for reasons beyond our control, such as changing market conditions, increased competition,
discontinued product lines, and product obsolescence.  

Index   

Our
intellectual property and proprietary rights may be insufficient to protect our competitive position.   

Our
business depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark, trade
secret laws, and other restrictions on disclosure to protect our proprietary technologies. We cannot be sure that these measures
will provide meaningful protection for our proprietary technologies and processes. We cannot be sure that any patent issued to
us will be sufficient to protect our technology. The failure of any patents to provide protection to our technology would make
it easier for our competitors to offer similar products. In connection with our participation in the development of various industry
standards, we may be required to license certain of our patents to other parties, including our competitors that develop products
based upon the adopted standards.  

We
also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, distributors, and strategic partners, and generally control
access to our documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third-party
to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products, services, or technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently,
or design around our patents.  

Effective
copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries.  

We
may become subject to claims of intellectual property rights infringement, which could result in substantial liability.   

In
the course of operating our business, we may receive claims of intellectual property infringement or otherwise become aware of
potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties. Many of our competitors have large intellectual
property portfolios, including patents that may cover technologies that are relevant to our business. In addition, many smaller
companies, universities, and individuals have obtained or applied for patents in areas of technology that may relate to our business.
The industry is moving towards aggressive assertion, licensing, and litigation of patents and other intellectual property rights.  

If
we are unable to obtain and maintain licenses on favorable terms for intellectual property rights required for the manufacture,
sale, and use of our products, particularly those products which must comply with industry standard protocols and specifications
to be commercially viable, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted.  

In
addition to disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of other parties  rights, we may become involved in
disputes relating to our assertion of our own intellectual property rights. Whether we are defending the assertion of intellectual
property rights against us or asserting our intellectual property rights against others, intellectual property litigation can
be complex, costly, protracted, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management
and key technical personnel. Plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief, and the measures of damages
in intellectual property litigation are complex and often subjective or uncertain. Thus, any adverse determinations in this type
of litigation could subject us to significant liabilities and costs.  

Index   

New
industry standards may require us to redesign our products, which could substantially increase our operating expenses.   

Standards
for the form and functionality of our products are established by standards committees. These independent committees establish
standards, which evolve and change over time, for different categories of our products. We must continue to identify and ensure
compliance with evolving industry standards so that our products are interoperable and we remain competitive. Unanticipated changes
in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software
developers. Should any major changes, even if anticipated, occur, we would be required to invest significant time and resources
to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry
standards for a significant period of time, we would miss opportunities to sell our products for use with new hardware components
from mobile computer manufacturers and OEMs, thus affecting our business.  

Undetected
flaws and defects in our products may disrupt product sales and result in expensive and time-consuming remedial action.   

Our
hardware and software products may contain undetected flaws, which may not be discovered until customers have used the products.
From time to time, we may temporarily suspend or delay shipments or divert development resources from other projects to correct
a particular product deficiency. Efforts to identify and correct errors and make design changes may be expensive and time consuming.
Failure to discover product deficiencies in the future could delay product introductions or shipments, require us to recall previously
shipped products to make design modifications, or cause unfavorable publicity, any of which could adversely affect our business
and operating results.  

The
loss of one or more of our senior personnel could harm our existing business.   

A
number of our officers and senior managers have been employed for more than twenty years by us, including our President, Chief
Financial Officer, Vice President of Operations and Vice President of Engineering/Chief Technical Officer. Our future success
will depend upon the continued service of key officers and senior managers. Competition for officers and senior managers is intense,
and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing senior personnel. The loss of one or more of our officers
or key senior managers could adversely affect our ability to compete.  

The
expensing of options will continue to reduce our operating results such that we may find it necessary to change our business practices
to attract and retain employees.   

Historically,
we have used stock options as a key component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock options provide an
incentive to our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of vesting, encourage valued employees
to remain with us. The expensing of employee stock options adversely affects our net income and earnings per share, will continue
to adversely affect future quarters, and will make profitability harder to achieve. In addition, we may decide in response to
the effects of expensing stock options on our operating results to reduce the number of stock options granted to employees or
to grant options to fewer employees. This could adversely affect our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified
candidates, and also could increase the cash compensation we would have to pay to them.  

Index   

If
we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled sales and marketing and product development personnel, our ability to develop
and market new products and product enhancements will be adversely affected.   

We
believe our ability to achieve increased revenues and to develop successful new products and product enhancements will depend
in part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled sales and marketing and product development personnel. Our products
involve a number of new and evolving technologies, and we frequently need to apply these technologies to the unique requirements
of mobile products. Our personnel must be familiar with both the technologies we support and the unique requirements of the products
to which our products connect. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain such key
personnel. In addition, our ability to hire and retain such key personnel will depend upon our ability to raise capital or achieve
increased revenue levels to fund the costs associated with such key personnel. Failure to attract and retain such key personnel
will adversely affect our ability to develop and market new products and product enhancements.  

Our
operating results could be harmed by economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with export sales.   

Our
operating results are subject to the risks inherent in export sales, including:  

longer
                                         payment cycles;    

unexpected
                                         changes in regulatory requirements, import and export restrictions and tariffs;    

difficulties
                                         in managing foreign operations;    

the
                                         burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws;    

greater
                                         difficulty or delay in accounts receivable collection;    

potentially
                                         adverse tax consequences; and     

political
                                         and economic instability.    

Our
export sales are primarily denominated in Euros for our sales to European distributors. Accordingly, an increase in the value
of the United States dollar relative to Euros could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially less competitive
in European market. Declines in the value of the Euro relative to the United States dollar may result in foreign currency losses
relating to collection of Euro denominated receivables if left unhedged.  

Our
operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, and other events beyond
our control.   

Our
corporate headquarters is located near an earthquake fault. The potential impact of a major earthquake on our facilities, infrastructure,
and overall business is unknown. Additionally, we may experience electrical power blackouts or natural disasters that could interrupt
our business. Should a disaster be widespread, such as a major earthquake, or result in the loss of key personnel, we may not
be able to implement our disaster recovery plan in a timely manner. Any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of these
events could have a material adverse effect on our business.  

Index   

Failure
to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price.   

We
have evaluated and will continue to evaluate our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires an annual management assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented
or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal
control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls,
particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important
to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating
results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock
could drop significantly.  

The
sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.   

Sales
of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price for our common
stock. The market price of our common stock could also decline if one or more of our significant stockholders decided for any
reason to sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market.  

As
of August 6, 2018, we had 5,883,109 shares of common stock outstanding. Substantially all of these shares are freely tradable
in the public market, either without restriction or subject, in some cases, only to S-3 prospectus delivery requirements and,
in other cases, only to manner of sale, volume, and notice requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act.  

As
of August 6, 2018, we had 2,358,134 shares of common stock subject to outstanding options under our stock option plans, and 132,693
shares of common stock were available for future issuance under the plans. We have registered the shares of common stock subject
to outstanding options and reserved for issuance under our stock option plans. Accordingly, the shares of common stock underlying
vested options will be eligible for resale in the public market as soon as the options are exercised.  

Index   

Volatility
in the trading price of our Common Stock could negatively impact the price of our Common Stock.   

During
the period from January 1, 2017 through August 6, 2018, our common stock price fluctuated between a high of $4.90 and a low of
$1.86. We have experienced low trading volumes in our stock, and thus relatively small purchases and sales can have a significant
effect on our stock price. The trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors,
some of which are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the outlook of securities analysts and investors
on our industry. In addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for high technology stocks in particular, have experienced
high volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations
may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.

(a)    Designed
                                         such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures
                                         to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to
                                         the registrant is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during
                                         the period in which this report is being prepared;

                                         financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance
                                         regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
                                         for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;    

(c)    Evaluated the effectiveness

                                         our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as
                                         of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and    

(d)    Disclosed in this report any
                                         change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred
                                         during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth
                                         fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably
                                         likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting;

5.    The registrant s other certifying

                                         over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee
                                         of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

                                         and    

(d)    Disclosed
                                         in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting
                                         that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s
                                         fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected,

                                         and
