INTERNATIONAL
BALER CORPORATION   

TABLE
OF CONTENTS   

NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  

1.
Nature of Business:  

International
Baler Corporation (the  Company ) is a manufacturer of baling equipment which is designed to compress a variety of
materials into bales for easier handling, shipping, disposal, storage, and for recycling. Materials commonly baled include scrap
metal, corrugated boxes, newsprint, aluminum cans, plastic bottles, and other solid waste. More sophisticated applications include
baling of textile materials, fibers and synthetic rubber. The Company offers a wide variety of balers, standard models as well
as custom models, and conveyors to meet specific customer requirements.  

The
Company s customers include recycling facilities, distribution centers, textile mills, and companies which generate the
materials for baling and recycling. The Company sells its products worldwide with annual sales outside the United States typically
ranging from 10% to 35%.  

2.
Basis of Presentation:  

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8-03 of Regulation
S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information in footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of
normal recurring accruals) considered necessary to make the financial statements not misleading have been included. Operating
results for the nine-month period ended July 31, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
year ending October 31, 2018. The accompanying balance sheet as of October 31, 2017 was derived from the audited financial statements
as of October 31, 2017.  

3.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:  

(a)
Accounts Receivable   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:  

Trade
accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses inherent in its accounts receivable. The Company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly
including the analysis of historical trends, customer credit worthiness and the aging of receivables. Account balances are charged
off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.   

(b)
Inventories:  

Prior
to the 2018 fiscal year, the Company reported inventories at the lower of cost or market. Effective November 1, 2017, the Company
began stating inventories prospectively at the lower of cost and net realizable value in accordance with Accounting Standards
Update 2015-11  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  Generally, under the prior method, market was replacement cost,
while net realizable value is based on the selling price of the inventory. This change had no significant effect on earnings.
Cost is determined by a method that approximates the first-in, first-out method. Work in process and finished goods are valued
based on underlying costs to manufacture balers which include direct materials, direct and indirect labor, and overhead. The Company
reviews inventory for obsolescence on a regular basis.  

(c)
Revenue Recognition:  

The
Company recognizes revenue when finished products and/or parts are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk
of loss. Revenue from installation services is recognized on completion of the service. The Company recognizes revenue from repair
services in the period in which the service is provided.  

(d)
Warranties and Service:  

The
Company typically warrants its products for one (1) year from the date of sale as to materials and six (6) months as to labor,
and offers services for other required repairs and maintenance. Service is rendered by repairing or replacing parts at the Company s
Jacksonville, Florida facility, by on-site service provided by Company personnel who are based in Jacksonville, Florida or by
local service agents who are engaged as needed. The Company maintains an accrued liability for expected warranty claims. The warranty
accrual is based on historical warranty costs, the quantity and types of balers currently under warranty, and known warranty issues.  

Following
is a tabular reconciliation of the changes in the warranty accrual for the nine-month period ended July 31:  

(e)
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:  

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short term certificates of
deposit, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and customer deposits, approximate their fair value due to
the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.  

(f)
Recent Accounting Pronouncements:  

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . This guidance supersedes
the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the
topic. The guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers
in an amount that reflects the considerations to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  

In
August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective
Date . The amendments in ASU 2015-14 defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public entities
should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting
periods within that reporting period. The Company does not believe this will have a significant impact on the financial statements,
as generally, contracts contain one distinct performance obligation and specifically state the performance obligation is the delivery
of equipment in exchange for a stated consideration. Contracts are not long term and balers are manufactured for individual orders
and revenue recognized at time of shipment.  

4. Related
Party Transactions:  

Leland
E. Boren, a stockholder and director of the Company, is the owner of Avis Industrial Corporation (Avis). Mr. Boren controls over
80% of the outstanding shares of the Company. Avis owns 100% of The American Baler Company and Harris Waste Management Group,
Inc., both competitors of the Company. These baler companies operate completely independent of each other. The Company had no
purchases from these companies in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 or in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017. The Company
had no sales to The American Baler Company in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 or the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017.
The Company sold four balers and one conveyor to Harris Waste Management for $238,377 in the first nine months of fiscal 2018
and had no sales to Harris Waste Management in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017.  

5.
Inventories:  

Inventories
consisted of the following:  

6. Debt:  

The
Company has a $1,650,000 line of credit agreement with First Merchants Bank of Muncie, Indiana which was renewed on May 15, 2018.
The line of credit allows the Company to borrow at an interest rate equal to the Wall Street Journal prime rate minus 0.95%, adjusting
daily. The line of credit is secured by all assets of the Company and expires on May 15, 2019. The line of credit had no outstanding
balance at July 31, 2018 and at October 31, 2017.  

7. Income
Taxes:  

Tax
assets are recognized in the balance sheet if it is more likely than not that they will be realized on future tax returns. Factors
considered included, historical results of operations, volatility of the economic conditions and projected earnings based on current
operations. Based on this evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized. Accordingly, there
is no valuation allowance as of July 31, 2018 and at October 31, 2017. However, if it is determined that all or part of the deferred
tax assets will not be used in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged against net income in the
period such determination is made. As of July 31, 2018 and October 31, 2017, net deferred tax assets were $26,975 and $37,348,
respectively.  

The
Company records interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in selling, general, and administrative
expenses.  

The
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the  Act ) was signed into United States tax law on December 22, 2017. The Act made
significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a Federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%, and
changes in business-related exclusions, and deductions and credits. As a result of the income tax rate reduction, the Company
reduced net deferred income tax assets by approximately $10,000 during the first quarter ending January 31, 2018.  

8. Commitments
and Contingencies:  

The
Company, in the ordinary course of business, is subject to claims made, and from time to time is named as a defendant in legal
proceedings relating to the sales of its products. The Company believes that the reserves reflected in its financial statements
are adequate to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses which may result from such claims and proceedings; however, such estimates
may be more or less than the amount ultimately paid when the claims are settled. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition
of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or
liquidity.  

On
December 1, 2017 the Company was served with a complaint related to an injury to an employee working at Integrated Coating and
Seed Technology Inc., (INCOTEC). The employee was operating a baler manufactured by the Company in 1994. The injury occurred on
December 4, 2015. The plaintiff is Star Insurance Company. The Company s insurer has retained an attorney and has begun
the discovery process. The Company believes its exposure is a range of $0 to $25,000, the amount of the Company s deductible
on its insurance policy. Accordingly, the Company accrued $25,000 during the six months ended April 30, 2018.  

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The
following discussion should be read together with our unaudited financial statements and the related notes thereto included in
Part I, Item 1  Financial Statements . For further information, refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended October 31, 2017, and the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
included in this Form 10-Q.  

Results
of Operations: Three Month Comparison  

In
the third quarter ended July 31, 2018, the Company had net sales of $2,021,957 compared to net sales of $3,111,959 in the third
quarter of fiscal 2017. The lower sales was the result of lower equipment shipments in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, fifteen
balers and conveyors in fiscal 2018 versus twenty-three in fiscal 2017. The lower shipments were the result of market conditions
including lower prices for recycled materials.  

The
Company had net income of $4,939 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to net income of $81,134 in the third quarter of
fiscal 2017. The lower income was the result of the lower shipments of balers and conveyors in the quarter.  

Results
of Operations: Nine Month Comparison  

The
Company had net sales of $7,995,225 in the first nine months of fiscal 2018, compared to net sales of $8,015,473 in the same period
of 2017. The Company shipped fifty-six balers and conveyors at an average price of approximately $104,000 in the first nine months
of fiscal 2018 compared to seventy-four balers and conveyors at an average price of approximately $80,000 in fiscal 2017. The
market for balers has been trending toward larger equipment for several years and the Company expects this trend to continue.  

The
Company had net income of $151,156 in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to net income of $89,840 in the same period
of fiscal 2017. The higher net income was the result of slightly higher gross profit margins from higher parts sales and lower
selling and administrative expenses. The lower selling expenses were due to lower advertising expenses, conventions and show expense
partially offset by higher salary expenses. The lower administrative expenses were the result of lower salary expenses and insurance
costs.  

The
sales order backlog was approximately $3,140,000 at July 31, 2018 and $3,190,000 at July 31, 2017.  

Financial
Condition and Liquidity:  

Net
working capital at July 31, 2018 was $7,723,365 as compared to $7,513,149 at October 31, 2017. The Company currently believes
that it will have sufficient cash flow to be able to fund operating activities for the next twelve months.  

Average
days sales outstanding (DSO) in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 were 22.8 days, as compared to 26.4 days in the first nine
months of fiscal 2017. DSO is calculated by dividing the total of the month-end net accounts receivable balances for the period
by three, and dividing that result by the average day s sales for the period (period sales   273).  

During
the nine months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company made additions to plant and equipment of $91,813 and $16,826 respectively.  

The
Company has a $1,650,000 line of credit agreement with First Merchants Bank of Muncie, Indiana which was renewed on May 15, 2018.
The line of credit allows the Company to borrow at an interest rate equal to the Wall Street Journal prime rate minus 0.95%, adjusting
daily. The line of credit is secured by all assets of the Company and expires on May 15, 2019. The line of credit had no outstanding
balance at July 31, 2018 and at October 31, 2017.  

In
the event that the Company s line of credit would not be available, the Company would pursue a line of credit from other
sources, and take steps to minimize expenditures, such as delaying capital expenditures and reducing overhead costs.  

Forward
Looking Statements  

Certain
statements in this Report contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21B of the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements represent the Company s present expectations or beliefs concerning
future events. The Company cautions that such statements are necessarily based on certain assumptions which are subject to risks
and uncertainties including, but not limited to, changes in general economic conditions and changing competition which could cause
actual results to differ materially from those indicated.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

The
Company is exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of its financing activities, including its borrowings on the revolving
line of credit facility. Based on the current level of borrowings, a change in interest rates is not expected to have a material
effect on operations or financial position.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Controls
and Procedures  

The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) / Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management
is necessarily required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, and under the supervision and with the participation of the management, including
the Company s CEO/CFO, management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of these disclosure controls and
procedures. Based on this evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Company s CEO/CFO concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  

Management,
with the participation of the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers, also assessed the effectiveness
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2018. This assessment was performed using the
criteria established under the Internal Control-Integrated Framework established by Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the
Treadway Commission ( COSO ).  

As
part of a continuing effort to improve the Company s business processes management is evaluating its internal controls and
may update certain controls to accommodate any modifications to its business processes or accounting procedures.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

The
Company s management, including CEO/CFO, confirm that there were no changes in the Company s internal control over
financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
