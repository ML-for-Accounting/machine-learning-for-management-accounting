Novus
Robotics Inc. ( Novus  or  the Company ), formerly known as Ecoland International Inc. ( Ecoland ),
a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on June 24, 2005 under the name Guano Distributors, Inc. for the purpose of selling Dry-Bar
Cave bat guano. On June 28, 2006, the articles of incorporation were amended to change its name to Ecoland. On March 13, 2012,
the articles of incorporation were amended to change the Company s name to Novus. The Company carries on business in one
segment being the engineering, design and the manufacturing of automated tube processing solutions for the automotive industry.  

2.     Significant
                                         Accounting Policies     

Basis
of Presentation   

These
interim consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States and are expressed in US dollars. The functional currency of Novus is the Canadian Dollar.  

The
interim consolidated financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, all
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair statement of results in accordance with
General Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ), have been included and properly prepared
within reasonable limits of materiality and within the framework of the significant accounting policies summarized below.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of Novus and its wholly owned subsidiaries D R
Technologies Inc and D R Toolings Inc. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Financial statement items subject to significant judgment include expense accruals, as well as income taxes and loss contingencies.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

The
areas which require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining carrying values include,
but are not limited to:

                                         ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued     

Assets 
carrying values and impairment charges    

Assets,
including property and equipment and inventory, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that their carrying amount exceeds their recoverable amounts. In the determination of carrying values and impairment charges,
management looks at the higher of recoverable amount or fair value less costs to sell in the case of assets and at objective evidence,
significant or prolonged decline of fair value on financial assets indicating impairment. These determinations and their individual
assumptions require that management make a decision based on the best available information at each reporting period.  

Income
taxes and recoverability of potential deferred tax assets   

In
assessing the probability of realizing income tax assets recognized, management makes estimates related to expectations of future
taxable income, applicable tax planning opportunities, expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the
likelihood that tax positions taken will be sustained upon examination by applicable tax authorities. In making its assessments,
management gives additional weight to positive and negative evidence that can be objectively verified. Estimates of future taxable
income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. The Company
considers whether relevant tax planning opportunities are within the Company s control, are feasible, and are within management s
ability to implement. Examination by applicable tax authorities is supported based on individual facts and circumstances of the
relevant tax position examined in light of all available evidence. Where applicable tax laws and regulations are either unclear
or subject to ongoing varying interpretations, it is reasonably possible that changes in these estimates can occur that materially
affect the amounts of income tax assets recognized. Also, future changes in tax laws could limit the Company from realizing the
tax benefits from the deferred tax assets. The Company reassesses unrecognized income tax assets at each reporting period.  

Warranty
Provision   

In
assessing the warranty provision, management makes estimates related to expectations of future repair cost needed to service new
seat frame sales under its two year warranty terms. These determinations and their individual assumptions require that management
make a decision based on the best available information at each reporting period  

Long-lived
Assets   

In
accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) ASC No. 360,  Property, Plant and Equipment 
the carrying value of intangible assets and other long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts
or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future
cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying
amount of the asset over its estimated fair value.

                                         ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued     

Regulatory
Matters   

The
Company is subject to a variety of federal, provincial and state regulations governing land use, health, safety and environmental
matters. The Company s management believes it has been in substantial compliance with all such regulations.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
At June 30, 2018, the Company had no cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which may exceed
federally insured limits. As of June 30, 2018, the Company s accounts are insured for $100,000 CDN by Canadian Deposit Insurance
Corporation for Canadian bank deposits  and are insured for $250,000 by FDIC for US bank
deposits .  

Factoring
Agreement and Accounts Receivable   

The
Company has a financing agreement that included a non-recourse factoring arrangement that provides nonrecourse factoring on the
Company s receivable from its primary customer Johnson Controls, Inc. to assist in its operational cash flow requirements.
The factor is based on credit approved orders, assumes the accounts receivable risk of the Company s customer in the event
of insolvency or non-payment. The Company assumes the risk on accounts receivable not factored to which is shown as accounts receivable
on the accompanying balance sheets. As of June 30,2018, the Company had $20,170 and had $23,243 at December 31, 2017 of factored
receivables. Finance charges associated with the sale of factored receivable for the period ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017
were $2,411 and $6,068 and are included in office and general expense.  

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts   

The
Company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the Company s
best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company s existing accounts receivable. The Company determines
the allowance based on specific customer information, historical write-off experience and current industry and economic data.
Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the Company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.
Management believes that there are no concentrations of credit risk for which an allowance has not been established. Although
management believes that the allowance is adequate, it is possible that the estimated amount of cash collections with respect
to accounts receivable could change. As of June 30, 2018, the Company has not deemed any accounts uncollectible.

Inventory   

Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) method. Cost of work in progress
and finished goods includes raw materials, direct labor and indirect manufacturing costs. The Company s inventory
balance at June 30, 2018 was comprised of work-in-progress. This policy requires D R to make estimates
regarding the market value of our inventory, including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventory. The Company determines
excess and obsolete inventory based on an estimate of the future demand and estimated selling prices for its
products.  

Fixed
Assets   

Fixed
assets are stated at cost. Depreciation is recorded on a straight line basis reflective of the useful lives of the assets. Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations when incurred, while additions and betterments are capitalized. When assets
are retired or disposed, the asset s original cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from accounts and
any gain or loss is reflected in income.

Foreign
Currency Translation   

Gains
and losses arising upon settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination
of income. The Company s functional currency is the Canadian dollar. Transactions in foreign currency are translated into
Canadian dollars then translated into U.S. dollars for reporting in accordance with the ASC 830-30 as follows:  

For assets and liabilities, the exchange rate at the balance sheet date shall be used.  

For revenues, expenses, gains, and losses, the exchange rate at the dates on which those elements are recognized shall be used.  

Translation
adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of shareholders  equity.  

Financial
Instruments   

The
carrying values of the Company s financial instruments, which comprise cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, payroll
liabilities, loan payable, taxes payable and due to officers/shareholders, approximate their fair values due to the immediate
or short-term maturity of these instruments. Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure
to foreign currency risk.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued   

Fair
Value Measurements   

The
authoritative guidance for fair values establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring
fair value. Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than
quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs
in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.  

Income
T  axes   

Potential
benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted
ASC 740,  Accounting for Income Taxes,  as of its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740, the Company is required to compute
tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized
in these financial statements because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will be able to utilize the
net operating losses carried forward in future years.  

Recorded
in other (income) and expenses are monies recovered relating to non-refundable, federal government Scientific Research   Experimental
Development ( SR ED ) tax credits. Due to the uncertain nature of these expenditures, the Company does not record
any amount until such time as the deduction is approved by Canadian provincial and federal governments.  

Advertising
Costs   

Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred. No advertising costs have been incurred by the Company to date.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASC 606 ).
In accordance with ASC 606, Novus applies the following methodology to recognize revenue:  

i.  
      Identify
    the contract with a customer.   

ii.  
      Identify
    the performance obligations in the contract.   

iii.  
      Determine
    the transaction price.   

iv.  
      Allocate
    the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.   

v.  
      Recognize
    revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued   

Accordingly,
the Company recognizes specific components of revenue as described below:    

1.  
      Spare
    parts   Revenues and cost of sales are recognized at the time of sale.   

2.  
      Service
      Revenues and cost of sales are recognized at the time services are performed and accepted by customer via sign off.   

3.  
      Seat
    systems and tooling   progress invoicing to the customer are recorded as deferred revenue. When the projects are installed
    and accepted by the customer the final invoice is issued and all deferred revenue is recognized along with the related work
    in process costs for the project. Systems generally take 20-28 weeks to design, manufacture, assemble, and then ship to our
    various customers. As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 customer deposits were $180,886 and $828,184 respectively.   

D R
provides standard warranties for its product from the date of shipment. Estimated warranty obligations are recorded at the time
of sale and amortized over the two year warranty period. As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, warranty liability was $41,069
and $18,529.  

Earnings
per Common Share   

Net
income per share is provided in accordance with ASC 260-10,  Earnings per Share . We present basic income per share
( EPS ) and diluted EPS the face of the statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing reported net income
(loss) applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Except
where the result would be anti-diluted to income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share would be computed assuming
the conversion of the convertible long-term debt and the elimination of the related interest expense, and the exercise of stock
warrants. Income per common share has been computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
year.  

Comprehensive
Income   

The
Company has adopted ASC 220,  Comprehensive Income,  which establishes standards for reporting and the display of
comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income (loss) is defined to include all changes in
equity except those resulting from investments by owners or distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, ASC 220 requires
that all items that are required to be recognized under the current accounting standards as a component of comprehensive income
be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. Comprehensive income
(loss) is displayed in the balance sheet as a component of shareholders  equity.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

The
Company has evaluated recent accounting updates and the potential impact upon adoption from which Novus has discerned that any
new accounting standard updates are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.

OBLIGATION UNDER CAPITAL LEASE   

The
Company entered into a lease to purchase equipment in November of 2015. An initial payment of $16,900 was made with the balance
of the lease to be satisfied in 36 equal monthly payments of approximately $820. The interest rate related to the lease obligation
is 14% with a maturity date of November 2018 at which time the option exists to purchase the equipment for $4,600.  

5.
COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK   

On
October 26, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split of one for three hundred reverse stock split of the Company s
total issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The Reverse Stock Split was affected on January 21, 2016 and reduced the
total number of issued and outstanding common shares from 88,650,000 to 296,641. The resultant decrease in the value attributed
to the common stock was transferred to Additional Paid In Capital ( APIC ) in the amount of $88,354. All share and
related stock option information presented in these consolidated financial statements has been retroactively adjusted to the reduced
number of shares resulting from this transaction.  

Each
share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible on a one-for-one basis into common stock, has all of the voting rights that the
holders of the common shares and has the ability to elect three directors.  

The
Series B Preferred Stock ( Series B ) has voting rights whose holders must vote together with the common stock. Each
Series B share has the same number of votes equal to 5,000 common shares and in the event of a stock split, share dividend or
otherwise for the common shares will retain this voting proportion.

were formed in the State of Nevada on June 24, 2005 under the name Guano Distributors, Inc. Prior to our incorporation, on April
15, 2005, David Wallace, our then-chief executive officer, chief financial officer and sole director, formed Guano Distributors
(Pty) Ltd., a South African registered company, for the purpose of selling Dry-Bar Cave bat guano. On May 15, 2005, Mr. Wallace
transferred all of his ownership interest in Guano Distributors (Pty) Ltd. to us. On June 28, 2006, we amended our Articles of
Incorporation to change our name to Ecoland International, Inc.  

Please
note that throughout this Quarterly Report, and unless otherwise noted, the words  we,   our,   us, 
the  Company,  or  Novus Robotics,  refers to Novus Robotics Inc.  

Share
Exchange Agreement   

Ecoland
International, Inc., now known as Novus Robotics Inc., D R Technology Inc., a private corporation ( D R
Technology ) and, Berardino Paolucci and Drakso Karanovic, the shareholders of D R Technology Inc. (the
 D R Shareholders ) entered into that certain share exchange agreement dated January 27, 2012 (the
 Share Exchange Agreement ). Our Board of Directors approved the execution and consummation of the transaction
under the Share Exchange Agreement on February 1, 2012. In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Share Exchange
Agreement, we issued an aggregate of 59,000,000 pre-Reverse Stock Split shares of our restricted common stock to the D R
Shareholders (which consisted of Messrs. Paolucci and Karanovic and D Mecatronics, which is holding the shares for the
benefit of the remaining shareholders of D R Technology) in exchange for 100% of the total issued and outstanding shares
of D R Technology, thus making D R Technology its wholly-owned subsidiary. Our Board of Directors deemed it in the
best interests of our shareholders to enter into the Share Exchange Agreement pursuant to which it would acquire all the
technology and assets and assume all liabilities of D R Technology. This resulted in a change in control and our overall
business operations thus bringing potential value to our shareholders. D R Technology was previously the wholly-owned
subsidiary of D Mecatronics Inc., a Delaware corporation. On approximately November 10, 2011, D Mecatronics spun-off D R
Technology. D R Technology subsequently issued shares of its restricted common stock to the shareholders of D
Mecatronics on a pro-rata basis in accordance with their respective equity holdings in D Mecatronics. The equity percentages
regarding the issuance of shares by D R Technology were 48% to Berardino Paolucci, 24% to Drasko Karanovic and 28% to
various shareholders (which shares were previously held by D Mecatronics on behalf of these shareholders).  

Escrow
Agreement.   

On
June 4, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the execution of that certain escrow agreement dated June 4, 2013 (the  Escrow
Agreement ) with Manhattan Transfer Registrar Co., our transfer agent ( Manhattan Transfer ). As disclosed in
previous filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on approximately November 10, 2011, D Mecatronics Inc. ( D
Mecatronics ) spun-off our wholly-owned subsidiary, D R Technology. D R Technology subsequently issued shares of
its restricted common stock to the shareholders of D Mecatronics on a pro-rata basis in accordance with their respective equity
holdings in D Mecatronics. The equity percentages regarding the issuance of shares by D R Technology were 48% to Berardino
Paolucci, 24% to Drasko Karanovic and 28% to various shareholders (which shares were being held by D Mecatronics on behalf of
these shareholders). The transfer agent for D Mecatronics at the time of the spin-off was Global Sentry Equity Transfer Inc. ( Global
Sentry ). At the time of the spin-off, management of D Mecatronics had attempted on several occasions to contact Global
Sentry with regards to its shareholder list and records. However, any and all attempts were to no avail. To date, D Mecatronics
has not been able to obtain any of its records, including a shareholders list, from Global Sentry. Management has no knowledge
or information as to the whereabouts of Global Sentry or its management nor of the location of its records and shareholders list.
This has impeded the issuance of the shares of D R Technology to the appropriate 28% minority shareholders of D Mecatronics
and thus the reason why D Mecatronics was holding the shares in trust for the benefit of its shareholders.  

Subsequently,
we entered into the Share Exchange Agreement. Our Board of Directors had approved the execution and consummation of the transaction
under the Share Exchange Agreement on February 1, 2012. In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Share Exchange Agreement,
we issued an aggregate of 59,000,000 pre-reverse stock split shares of our restricted common stock to the D R Shareholders
(which consisted of Messrs. Paolucci and Karanovic and D Mecatronics, which held the shares for the benefit of the remaining shareholders
of D R Technology) in exchange for 100% of the total issued and outstanding shares of D R Technology, thus making D R
Technology our wholly-owned subsidiary. The Board of Directors deemed it in the best interests of the shareholders to enter into
the Share Exchange Agreement pursuant to which it would acquire all the technology and assets and assume all liabilities of D R
Technology.  

The
majority shareholders of D R Technology approved the Share Exchange Agreement as did its Board of Directors. The Board of
Directors of D R Technology resolved in its board resolutions to issue to D Mecatronics the 16,520,000 pre-reverse stock split
shares on behalf of the missing 28% minority shareholders of D R Technology (who are also the unknown shareholders of D Mecatronics).  

Therefore,
D Mecatronics held in trust and for the benefit of its unknown shareholders (and as shareholders of D R Technology) the shares
to be issued to them by the Company. D Mecatronics is in the process of attempting to locate the transfer agent in order to obtain
its records.  

We
are also in the process of locating the missing shareholders of D Mecatronics (and also as shareholders of D R Technology)
to whom our shares should be issued in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Share Exchange Agreement. Therefore, we
entered into the Escrow Agreement. In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement, D Mecatronics returned
to Manhattan Transfer the share certificate evidencing the shares of our common stock issued to it as trustee. A new share certificate
was issued to Manhattan Transfer as trustee in the aggregate denomination of 16,520,000 shares to be held in escrow. Together
with Manhattan Transfer, we created a shareholders list (the  Shareholders List ) indicating each record owner of
the shares. Subsequent to the date of the Escrow Agreement, Manhattan Transfer has released shares to certain of the persons indicated
on the Shareholders List. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, Manhattan Transfer has issued approximately 5,331,641 of the
16,520,000 shares held in escrow to the shareholders listed on the Shareholder List.  

We
will place on our website www.novusrobotics.com (which is currently under construction) under  Investor Relations 
contact information to be used by persons/entities that believe they were shareholders of D Mecatronics. Such individuals/entities
should contact our management.

Three
Month Period Ended June    30, 2018 Compared to Three Month Period Ended June 30, 2017.   

We
generated revenue during the three month period ended June 30, 2018 in the amount of $1,799,908 compared to $1,022,570 generated
during the three month period ended June 30, 2017 (an increase of $777,338). Major components of the revenue mix for change from
June 30, 2018 to June 30, 2017 are as follows:  

1.  
      Prototypes
    Parts   decreased $162,570 for prototypes for Adient/JCI projects as no projects were initiated in the second quarter
    of 2018.   

2.  
      Spare
    Parts and Services increased $4,600 for replacement parts required by many customers including Adient, Toyota, PWO Kitchener,
    Van Rob Mexico and Adient Athens to replace worn parts.   

3.  
       Retrofit
Systems - increased $107,640. We assess old machines and recommend that specified work needs to be done on them. This includes
all mechanical , electrical, hydraulic and pneumatics as required. We then replace worn parts on old benders overhauled benders
for Adient - Lakewood System C, Adient   Athens, PWO - Kitchener, Adient   Ramos move machines for customers, install
additional tooling units on existing benders. We did a retrofit for a machine at Adient.    

4.  
      Seat
    Frame System - increase of $827,668 as one machine was sold during Q2 2017 compared to the 3 unitst sold during Q2 2018. They
    were to existing and new customers.   

5.  
       Medical
        robotics, personal robotic devices and water treatment industry We have not generated revenue from these sources as yet
        and will continue to investigate opportunities in these areas to augment its core business.  

Cost
of sales:  During the three month period ended June 30, 2018, cost of sales was $1,332,109 compared to $612,766 during the
three month period ended June 30, 2017 (a increase of $719,343). The change in products sold in the three month period ended June
30, 2018 contributed to a decrease in our gross margin over the three month period ended June 30, 2017. Less work for retrofit
systems, where the majority of the costs are borne by the customer, did not assist in offsetting the lower product margins generated
on the sale of seat frames during the three month period ended June 30, 2018.  

Gross
Profit.  Thus, based on the above, our gross profit increased to $467,799 during the three month period ended June 30, 2018
from $409,804 during the three month period ended June 30, 2017.  

Operating
expenses:  During the three month period ended June 30, 2018, we incurred operating expenses in the amount of $330,892
compared to operating expenses incurred during the three month period ended June 30, 2017 of $240,026 (a increase of
$90,866). Operating expenses include: (i) compensation of $145,728 (2017: $152,510); (ii) occupancy costs of $17,244 (2017:
$16,681); (iii) travel of $33,629 (2017: $12,113); (iv) professional fees of $86,706 (2017: $37,113); (v) communication of
$2,527 (2017: $2,084); and (vi) office and general of $45,058(2017: $19,524). In respect of compensation, more labor charges
were capitalized to the work in process projects during the three month period ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three
month period ended June 30, 2018 due to the timing and completion of specific projects resulting in a decrease of $6,782
being charged in 2018. Travel increased by $21,516 as we installed 3 machines in 2018 compared to 1 in 2017, on acquiring new
customers and opportunities during the three month period ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2018.
Professional fees increased by $49,593 in the three month period ended June 30, 2018 as the additional charges associated
with our auditors were incurred during this time frame, which we did not incur in 2017. Office and general expenses increased
by $25,533 due to increase of office costs, and rebates during 2018.  

Income
from Operations.  Thus, this resulted in net income before other income or expenses of $136,907 during the three month period
ended June 30, 2018 compared to income before other income of $169,778 during the three month period ended June 30, 2017.  

Other
Income (Expense).  During the three month period ended June 30, 2018, we recorded $53,203 in other income as compared to other
income of $5,165 recorded in the three month period ended June 30, 2017. The continued fluctuation of the Canadian dollar in 2018
and 2017 against the United States dollar resulted during the three month period ended June 30, 2018 in a foreign exchange gain
of $53,203 compared to a foreign exchange gain of $5,165 during the three month period ended June 30, 2017 on denominations transacted
and settled in foreign currencies, primarily being sales to the United States from which the monies are being converted and used
to satisfy Canadian dollar operational requirements.  

Net
income before income taxes.  Thus, during the three month period ended June 30, 2018, this resulted in net income before income
taxes of $190,111 compared to net income before income taxes of $174,943 during the three month period ended June 30, 2017.  

Provision
for Income taxes.  During the three month period ended June 30, 2018, we incurred 0 in income taxes compared to ($28,266) during

($83,075) as compared to ($10,168) during the three month period ended June 30, 2017.  

Comprehensive
Income.  Thus, during the three month period ended June 30, 2018, our comprehensive income was $107,036 or $0.00 per share
compared to comprehensive income of $136,510 or $0.00 for the three month period ended June 30, 2017. The weighted average number
of shares outstanding was 54,296,541 for the three month periods ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively.  

Six
Month Period Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to Six Month Period Ended June 30, 2017.   

We
generated revenue during the six month period ended June 30, 2018 in the amount of $2,321,207 compared to $3,110,862 generated
during the six month period ended June 30, 2017 (a decrease of $789,656). Major components of the revenue mix for change from

                                                         recommend that specified work needs to be done on them. This includes all mechanical , electrical, hydraulic and pneumatics
                                                         as required. We then replace worn parts on old benders overhauled benders for Adient - Lakewood System C, Adient  
                                                         Athens, PWO - Kitchener, Adient   Ramos move machines for customers, install additional tooling units on existing
                                                         benders.    

4.  
      Seat
    Frame System - decrease of $347,700 as 2 machines were sold during 6 months of 2017 at a higher price point compared to the
    three units sold during first six months of 2018.   

5.  
       Medical
        robotics, personal robotic devices and water treatment industry We have not generated revenue from these sources as yet
        and will continue to investigate opportunities in these areas to augment its core business.  

Cost
of sales:  During the six month period ended June 30, 2018, cost of sales was $1,573,501 compared to $1,712,964 during the
six month period ended June 30, 2017 (a decrease of $139,463). The change in products sold in the six month period ended June
30, 2018 contributed to a decrease in our gross margin over the six month period ended June 30, 2017. Less work for retrofit systems,
where the majority of the costs are borne by the customer, did not assist in offsetting the lower product margins generated on
the sale of seat frames during the six month period ended June 30, 2018.  

Gross
Profit.  Thus, based on the above, our gross profit decreased to $747,706 during the six month period ended June 30, 2018 from

2017 was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $159,606, a decrease in customer deposits of
$647,298 and a decrease in warranty provision of $22,540, and a decrese in obligation under capital lease of $2,652.

We
expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and generation
of revenues. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.  

PLAN
OF OPERATION   

Our
principal demands for liquidity are to increase capacity, inventory purchase, sales distribution, and general corporate purposes.
We are in the process of being accepted as a global prototype supplier by Johnson Controls compared to our prior role as a supplier
for North America. We had been involved in discussions with Johnson Controls regarding prototypes and parts production. Johnson
Controls visited our facility during early 2012 to conduct an audit for global recommendation. Their goal was to understand the
processes we use to run the business and the controls that we have in place so that we were assured to have utmost control over
the quality of work. The audit was based on our employees and their qualifications, data management, processes, tooling and equipment
and parts and material management. Johnson Controls conducted a tour of our facility, which was followed up with a final review
on May 3, 2012. Subsequently we received a call from Johnson Controls stating that we had been accepted and recommended for their
global work. Therefore, we have been accepted for global work and thus provided the basis for previously disclosed projections.
 We may achieve those revenue projections during fiscal year 2018, however, we may also not achieve that level of revenue.  

We
intend to meet our liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to the purchase of equipment, purchase of inventory,
and the expansion of its business, through cash flow provided by operations and funds raised through proceeds from the issuance
of debt or equity.  

With
a flexible labor force, workers are hired on a project by project basis, and strong inventory management, we are able to manage
our cash flow to meet the ever changing needs of the business. We can expand and contract very quickly based on customer demand.
Our major customers, JCI, Adient and Constellium, are consistently submitting new projects. We had $180,886 of project work in
process at the end of June 30, 2018 with a total contract value of approximately $570,394. We have received committed future orders
of $670,000., which are anticipated to be completed during the second half of 2018. Other revenue opportunities have historically
materialized to supplement this revenue being service and retooling.  

We
have not paid any sums for public relations or investor relations.  

MATERIAL
COMMITMENTS   

Other
than the lease obligation and note referenced below, we have no other reportable material commitments for the as of June 30, 2018.  

Lease   

We
currently have a three-year lease on a standalone building located at 7669 Kimbel Street, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, which
is 18,000 square feet. The building is located on approximately one acre of land. The building has two floors of office/engineering
space, 1,500 square feet, and the balance is used for its welding, assembly and machining areas. We also have two loading docks
for shipping.  

We
lease the premises with monthly lease payments of approximately CDN$8,400 per month. Total minimum lease payments of CDN$134,400
are required to the lease expiration date on July 31, 2019.  

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

We
evaluated recent accounting updates and the potential impact upon adoption. See Footnote No. 2 to the financial statements.  

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES   

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and plan of operations is based upon our interim consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). The preparation
of these interim financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate
our estimates including, among others, those affecting revenue, the allowance for doubtful accounts, the salability of inventory
and the useful lives of tangible and intangible assets. The discussion below is intended as a brief discussion of some of the
judgments and uncertainties that can impact the application of these policies and the specific dollar amounts reported on our
financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions, or if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates. Many of our estimates or judgments are
based on anticipated future events or performance, and as such are forward-looking in nature, and are subject to many risks and
uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We do not undertake any obligation to
update or revise this discussion to reflect any future events or circumstances.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

We
have performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2018 to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  

Based
on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered
by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective:  

to
    give reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
    Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and   

to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
    to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   

We
believe that the foregoing steps will remediate the significant deficiencies identified above, and we will continue to monitor
the effectiveness of these steps and make any changes that our management deems appropriate. A material weakness (within the meaning
of PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those
responsible for oversight of the company s financial reporting.  

During
our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, management identified significant
deficiencies related to: (i) the absence of an Audit Committee as of June 30, 2018; and (ii) a lack of segregation of duties within
accounting functions.  

We
began preparing to be in compliance with the internal control obligations, including Section 404, for our fiscal year ending December
31, 2018. In an effort to improve our internal control environment, management has engaged a Chartered Accountant to review the
work prepared by the controller. He is independent of the daily accounting function. He prepares the quarterly financial statement
after reviewing and recommending adjustments to the records based on his analysis of the financial information presented. This
review includes vouching and reconciling key accounts to source documents.  

In
order to correct the foregoing weaknesses, we have taken certain further remediation measures and designed new internal controls
and procedures to ensure: (a) effectiveness and efficiency of operations; (b) reliability of financial reporting; and (c) compliance
with laws and regulations. To that end, management will provide a controlled environment which organizes and influences its people.  

(a)  
      Management
    is establishing an information and communication system for its executives and employees allowing them to carry out their
    responsibilities in an organized and process driven manner.   

(b)  
      The
    firm engaged the Chartered Accountant to assist with: (a) compiling and maintaining our financial records; (b) assisting the
    bookkeeping staff with proper recording of transactions; (c) maintaining permanent accounting records and proper backup procedures;
    and (d) providing continuous monitoring of accounting functions throughout the company. In addition, the Chartered Accountant
    will perform a risk assessment which identifies and analyzes the relevant risks management should address in order to achievement
    of its objectives. The Chartered Accountant will also assist with the preparation of written policies and procedures that
    will help ensure management directives are carried out.   

(c)  
      Our
    President/Chief Executive Officer is serving as the point of communication between us and the audit firm. Communication between
    our President/Chief Executive Officer and the audit firm s engagement partner has been established to ensure that the
    audit is aware of management s intent and actions.   

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including
the chief executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of June 30, 2018. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO 2013 ) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment,
no progress toward remediation of our previously disclosed material weaknesses has been implemented.  

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls   

We
believe that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives
of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable
assurance of achieving their objectives, and our CEO and our CFO have concluded that these controls and procedures are not effective
at the  reasonable assurance  level.  

Changes
in internal controls   

There
were no changes in internal controls for the three month period ended June 30, 2018.  

AUDIT
COMMITTEE REPORT   

Our
Board of Directors has not established an audit committee. The respective role of an audit committee has been conducted by our
Board of Directors. We intend to establish an audit committee during fiscal year 2017. When established, the audit committee s
primary function will be to provide advice with respect to our financial matters and to assist our Board of Directors in fulfilling
its oversight responsibilities regarding finance, accounting, and legal compliance. The audit committee s primary duties
and responsibilities will be to: (i) serve as an independent and objective party to monitor our financial reporting process and
internal control system; (ii) review and appraise the audit efforts of our independent accountants; (iii) evaluate our quarterly
financial performance as well as its compliance with laws and regulations; (iv) oversee management s establishment and enforcement
of financial policies and business practices; and (v) provide an open avenue of communication among the independent accountants,
management and our Board of Directors.
