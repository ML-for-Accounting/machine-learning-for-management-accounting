  CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  COMPUTATION OF RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES 

___________________________________________________ 
   (1)      The interest amount in the table above does not include interest expense associated with uncertain tax positions.    
   (2)      Amounts represent those portions of rent expense that are reasonable approximations of interest costs. 
   (3)      We have not issued preferred stock. Therefore, the ratios of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends are the same as the ratios presented above.

              (a)

              (b)

              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
