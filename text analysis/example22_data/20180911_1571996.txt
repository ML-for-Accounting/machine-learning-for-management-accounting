NOTE 1       BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  References in these Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to the "Company" or "Dell Technologies" mean Dell Technologies Inc. individually and together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 
    
  Basis of Presentation     The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   February 2, 2018  , and the recast audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes for the fiscal years ended   February 2, 2018   and   February 3, 2017   (the   "  Recast Financial Statements  "  )  
  and other financial information included in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the   "  SEC  "  ) on August 6, 2018.  The Recast Financial Statements were recast from and supersede the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal years ended   February 2, 2018   and   February 3, 2017   included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   February 2, 2018  .  Such audited Consolidated Financial Statements were recast to present certain previously reported financial statements and other related financial information on a basis consistent with the new accounting standards adopted during the three months ended May 4, 2018.  Further, segment information was recast to conform with certain segment reporting changes the Company made during the three months ended May 4, 2018.  See below for additional information regarding recently adopted accounting pronouncements.  
    
  These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").  In the opinion of management, the accompanying Condensed  Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary to fairly state the financial position of Dell Technologies Inc. as of   August 3, 2018  , the results of its operations and corresponding comprehensive income (loss) for the three and six months ended   August 3, 2018   and   August 4, 2017  , and its cash flows for the six months ended   August 3, 2018   and   August 4, 2017  .  The February 2, 2018 condensed consolidated balance sheet included herein was derived from the Recast Financial Statements. 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes.  Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  The results of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the three and six months ended   August 3, 2018   and   August 4, 2017   and the cash flows for the six months ended   August 3, 2018   and   August 4, 2017   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year or for any other fiscal period. 
    
  The Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Friday nearest January 31.  The fiscal year ended   February 2, 2018   ("  Fiscal 2018  ") was a 52-week period, and the fiscal year ending   February 1, 2019   ("  Fiscal 2019  ") will be a 52-week period. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation     These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Dell Technologies and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as well as the accounts of SecureWorks Corp. ("SecureWorks"), VMware, Inc., and Pivotal Software, Inc. ("Pivotal"), each of which is majority-owned by Dell Technologies.  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. 
    
  Unless the context indicates otherwise, references in these   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   to "VMware" mean the VMware reportable segment, which reflects the operations of VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW) within Dell Technologies.  See Exhibit 99.1 filed with the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended   August 3, 2018   for information on the differences between VMware reportable segment results and VMware, Inc. results. 
    
  EMC Merger Transaction     On September 7, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition by merger of EMC Corporation ("EMC"), referred to as the EMC merger transaction.  The consolidated results of EMC are included in Dell Technologies' consolidated results presented in these financial statements. 
    
  Pivotal Initial Public Offering     On April 24, 2018, Pivotal completed a registered underwritten initial public offering ("IPO") of its Class A common stock.  The results of Pivotal's operations are included in other businesses.  For more information regarding the Company's ownership of Pivotal, see   Note 14   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  .

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Leases         In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued amended guidance on the accounting for leasing transactions.  The primary objective of this update is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.  The guidance also makes some changes to lessor accounting and requires additional disclosures about all leasing arrangements.  Companies are required to use a modified retrospective approach, with the option of applying the requirements of the standard either (1) retrospectively to each prior comparative reporting period presented, or (2) retrospectively at the beginning of the period of adoption.  The Company will adopt this standard for the fiscal year beginning February 2, 2019, and will apply it at the beginning of the period of adoption through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings.  In the area of lessee accounting, the Company anticipates that the most significant change will be recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  In the area of lessor accounting, the Company anticipates that the most significant change will be an increase to future originations of operating leases due to elimination of the third-party residual value guarantee insurance in the sales-type lease test.  
    
  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments         In June 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance which replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology for measurement of credit losses on financial instruments with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.  Public entities must adopt the new guidance for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment     In January 2017, the FASB issued amended guidance to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.  Instead, under the amendments in the new guidance, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.  An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.  Public entities must adopt the new guidance in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance but does not expect that the standard will have an impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers         In May 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers.  The objective of the new standard is to establish a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede substantially all of the existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.  The new standard requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  Further, the new standard requires additional disclosures to help enable users of the financial statements to better understand the nature, amount, timing, risks, and judgments related to revenue recognition and related cash flows from contracts with customers.  Concurrently, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for costs to fulfill or obtain a customer contract.  The Company adopted these standards during the three months ended   May 4, 2018   using the full retrospective method, which requires the Company to recast each prior period presented consistent with the new guidance.  The Company recorded a credit of approximately   $1 billion   to retained earnings as of January 29, 2016 to reflect the cumulative effect of the adoption.  See tables provided below which present the impact of the new accounting standards to the Company's previously reported financial results.  See also   Note 2   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for a summary of significant policies related to the new accounting standards. 
    
  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities     In January 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance that generally requires changes in the fair value of equity investments, other than those accounted for under the equity method, to be recognized through net income, rather than other comprehensive income.  For equity investments without readily determinable fair values, the Company is no longer permitted to use the cost method of accounting.  The Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative for those investments.  Under the alternative, the Company measures investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, adjusted by observable price changes on a prospective basis.  The

Company must make a separate election to use the alternative for each eligible investment, and is required to reassess at each reporting period whether an investment qualifies for the alternative.  The Company adopted this standard during the three months ended   May 4, 2018  .  Adoption of the standard was applied through a cumulative one-time adjustment to accumulated deficit of   $56 million   for the accumulated unrealized gain previously recorded in other comprehensive income.  The impact of the standard on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) during the three and six months ended   August 3, 2018   was a gain of approximately   $123 million   and   $223 million  , respectively, recognized in interest and other, net, and the impact in future periods will depend on the relative changes in market price of the equity investments. 
    
  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments     In August 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance on the presentation and classification of eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice.  Companies should reflect any adjustments on a retrospective basis, if practicable; otherwise, adoption is required to be applied as of the earliest date practicable.  The Company adopted this standard during the three months ended   May 4, 2018  .  Prior period amounts on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows have been recast to conform with current period presentation as shown in the reconciliation provided below. 
    
  Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory     In October 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance on the accounting for income taxes.  The new guidance requires companies to recognize the income tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs instead of when the asset is sold to a third party.  The new guidance was applied on a modified-retrospective basis with the cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  The Company early adopted this guidance during the three months ended May 5, 2017.  At adoption, approximately   $84 million   was reclassified from other non-current liabilities to accumulated deficit, resulting in a net credit to accumulated deficit. 
    
  Statement of Cash Flows, Restricted Cash     In November 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance requiring entities to include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in cash balances on the cash flow statement, and also to provide a supplemental reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.  Public entities must adopt the new guidance for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  The     Company adopted this standard during the three months ended   May 4, 2018  .  See   Note 19   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for supplemental cash flow information.  Prior period amounts on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows have been recast to conform with current period presentation as shown in the reconciliation provided below. 
    
  Clarifying the Definition of a Business     In January 2017, the FASB issued amended guidance to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses.  Public entities must adopt the new guidance for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  The new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's conclusions regarding transactions that were assessed in the current period. 
    
  Derivatives and Hedging         In August 2017, the FASB issued amended guidance that will make more financial and non-financial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting.  The amended guidance changes how companies assess effectiveness, and also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements.  The guidance is intended to simplify the application of hedge accounting and increase transparency as to the scope and results of hedging programs.  Immediate early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.  The Company elected to early adopt this standard during the three months ended   May 4, 2018  .  The impact of the adoption of the standard was immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income         In February 2018, the     FASB issued guidance that will permit entities to reclassify the tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income to accumulated deficit as a result of U.S. Tax Reform, discussed in   Note 12   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  .  The guidance gives entities the option to reclassify these amounts, but requires new disclosures regardless of whether they elect to do so.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company elected to early adopt this standard during the three months ended   May 4, 2018  , and recorded the impact of the adoption as a cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit.  The impact of the adoption was immaterial to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Impacts to Previously Reported Periods 
    
  The following tables present the impact of the new accounting standards to the Company's previously reported financial results. 
    
  Selected Captions from the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position 

____________________ 
           (a)  
    Amounts as reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2018. 
       
  The above impacts are summarized as follows: 
    
  Accounts receivable, net  .  The adoption of the new revenue standard resulted in an increase to accounts receivable, net primarily due to the following two factors: 

First, the return rights provision, which represents an estimate of expected customer returns, which was previously presented as a reduction of accounts receivable, net, is now being presented outside of accounts receivable, net in two separate balance sheet line items.  A liability is recorded in accrued and other for the estimated value of the sales amounts to be returned to the customer, and an asset is recorded in other current assets representing the recoverable cost of the inventory estimated to be returned.   

Second, the standard provides new guidance regarding transfer of control of goods to the customer.  Under these new guidelines, the Company has determined that for certain hardware contracts in the United States, transfer of control and recognition of revenue can occur earlier.  This resulted in an increase in accounts receivable, net and a decrease in the in-transit deferral recorded in other current assets. 
       
  Other assets  .  The adoption of the new revenue standard resulted in an increase in other assets due to capitalization of the costs to obtain a contract, as well as the accounts receivable, net of impacts discussed above.  
    
  Deferred revenue.    The adoption of the new revenue standard resulted in a decline in deferred revenue due to earlier recognition of revenue for software licenses, and less of the aggregate transaction price being allocated to extended warranty.  Deferred revenue was also reduced by the impact of variable consideration (i.e., price concessions, rebates, and refunds).  The reduction in deferred revenue was partially offset by an increase resulting from the change in presentation of deferred costs on third-party software offerings, which are reported in other assets, and are either sold on a standalone basis or as an attached component of the Company's hardware offering.  The Company previously reported the associated deferred revenue net of these deferred costs in deferred revenue.

Products revenue vs. services revenue.    The adoption of the new revenue standard resulted in a change to the classification of products revenue vs. services revenue, due to the following factors:   

Under the new revenue standard, amounts within a contract are now allocated to the product and services performance obligations based on their respective standalone selling prices, which generally increases product revenue and decreases services revenue relative to previously reported results. 
                
    Further, third-party software licenses were previously recognized in services revenue as the Company could not separate the value of the software license from the associated maintenance agreement.  Under the new revenue standard, the license value requires separation and will be recognized in product revenue and the value of the software maintenance will continue to be recognized in services revenue. 
       
  Operating expenses.     The adoption of the new revenue standard resulted in a decrease to operating expenses due to the deferral of the incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract.

NOTE 2         INTERIM UPDATE TO SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  As mentioned previously in Note 1 of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  , the Company adopted amended guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers during the three months ended May 4, 2018, using the full retrospective method.  The following accounting policies have been updated as part of the adoption of the new standard. 
    
  Revenue Recognition     The Company enters into a variety of agreements to provide a wide portfolio of products and services offerings to its customers.  These agreements have varying requirements depending on the goods and services being sold, the rights and obligations conveyed, and the legal jurisdiction of the arrangement. 
    
  Revenue is recognized either over time or at a point in time, depending on when the underlying goods or services are transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for delivering those goods or services.  The following five steps are applied to recognize revenue: 
    
           (1) 
    Identify the contract with a customer.    The term "contract" refers to the enforceable rights and obligations provided in an agreement between the Company and one or more other parties in exchange for payment.  The Company evaluates facts and circumstances regarding sales transactions in order to identify contracts with its customers.  An agreement must meet all of the following criteria to qualify as a contract eligible for revenue recognition under the model:  (i) the contract must be approved by all parties; (ii) each party's rights regarding the goods and services to be transferred to the customer can be identified; (iii) the payment terms for the goods and services can be identified; (iv) the customer has the ability and intent to pay and it is probable that the Company will collect substantially all of the consideration to which it will be entitled; and (v) the contract must have commercial substance.  Judgment is used in determining the customer's ability and intent to pay, which is based upon various factors including the customer's historical payment experience or customer credit and financial information. 
          
           (2) 
    Identify the performance obligations in the contract.    Distinct promises within a contract are referred to as "performance obligations" and are accounted for as separate units of account.  The Company assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the performance obligations in the contract.  This assessment involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual promised goods or services and whether such goods or services are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship.  Promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (that is, the good or service is capable of being distinct); and (ii) the Company's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (that is, the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).  The Company's performance obligations consist of a variety of products and services offerings which include: hardware, such as servers, storage, networking, personal computers, workstations, and peripherals; third-party software; proprietary software licenses; support and deployment services, which include hardware support that extends beyond the Company's standard warranties, software maintenance, and installation; professional services; training; software as a service ("SaaS"); and infrastructure as a service ("IaaS"). 
       
           (3) 
    Determine the transaction price.    Transaction price reflects the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer.  If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, the Company estimates the amount to which it expects to be entitled using either the expected value or most likely amount method.  The Company s contracts may include terms that could cause variability in the transaction price, including, for example, rebates, sales returns, and volume discounts.  In determining the transaction price, any variable consideration would be considered, to the extent applicable, if it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. 
       
           (4) 
    Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract.    Many of the Company s contracts include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer, and the transaction price must be allocated to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services.  For these contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated in proportion to the standalone selling price ("SSP") of each performance obligation.

  (unaudited) 

If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. 
    
  The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a good or service when the Company sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances to similar customers.  If a directly observable price is available, it must be utilized for the SSP.  If a directly observable price is not available, the SSP must be estimated.  The Company estimates SSP by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices, internal costs, and profit objectives as well as overall market conditions which include geographic or regional specific factors, competitive positioning, and competitor actions.  SSP can include fixed and variable components.  Variable components are estimated based on the most likely outcome or expected value of the variable components. 
    
           (5) 
    Recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.    Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract with the Company's customer are satisfied.  Revenue is recognized either over time or at a point in time, depending on when the underlying products or services are transferred to the customer.  Revenue is recognized at a point in time for products upon transfer of control.  Revenue is recognized over time for support and deployment services, professional services, training, software support, SaaS, and IaaS. 
       
  The Company reports revenue net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrently with specific revenue-producing transactions. 
    
  The Company has elected the following practical expedients with the adoption of the new revenue standard: 

The Company does not account for significant financing components if the period between revenue recognition and when the customer pays for the product or service will be one year or less. 
                
    The Company recognizes revenue equal to the amount it has a right to invoice when the amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company's performance to date. 
                
    The Company does not account for shipping and handling activities as a separate performance obligation, but rather as an activity performed to transfer the promised good. 
       
  The following summarizes the nature of revenue recognized and the manner in which the Company accounts for sales transactions. 
    
  Products 
    
  Product revenue consists of hardware and software license sales that are delivered, sold as a subscription or sold on a consumption basis.  Hardware includes notebooks and desktop PCs, servers, storage hardware, and other hardware-related devices.  Software license sales include non-essential, stand-alone software applications.  Software applications provide customers with resource management, backup and archiving, information security, information management and intelligence, data analytics, and server virtualization capabilities.  
    
  Revenue from the sale of hardware products is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which typically occurs when the hardware has been shipped to the customer, risk of loss has transferred to the customer, the Company has a present right to payment, and customer acceptance has been satisfied.  Customer acceptance is satisfied if acceptance is obtained from the customer, if all acceptance provisions lapse, or if the Company has evidence that all acceptance provisions will be, or have been, satisfied.  Revenue from software license sales is generally recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which is typically upon shipment, electronic delivery, or when the software is available for download by the customer.  For certain arrangements, including software subscriptions and certain software license agreements which provide customers control to certain product performance obligations over time, revenue is recognized based on usage or ratably over the term of the arrangement based on the pattern of delivery of the product to the customer.   
    
  Invoices for products are generally issued as control transfers, which is typically upon shipment or electronic delivery.  There was no significant revenue in any period presented related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods.

Services 
    
  Services revenue consists of revenue from sales of support services, including hardware support that extends beyond the Company's standard warranties, software maintenance, and installation; professional services; training; SaaS; and IaaS.  Revenue associated with undelivered performance obligations is deferred and recorded as control is transferred to the customer over time.  Revenue from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts sold for both hardware and software is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of performance because the Company is required to provide services at any given time.  Other services revenue is recognized when the Company performs the services and the customers receive and consume the benefits. 
    
  Invoices for services may be issued at the start of a service term, which is typically the case for support and deployment services, or as services are rendered, which is typically the case for professional services, training, SaaS, and IaaS. 
    
  Other 
    
  Revenue from leasing arrangements is not subject to the revenue standard for contracts with customers, and remains separately accounted for under existing lease accounting guidance.  The Company records revenue from the sale of equipment under sales-type leases as product revenue in an amount equal to the present value of minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.  Sales-type leases also produce financing income, which is included in products net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and is recognized at consistent rates of return over the lease term.  The Company also offers qualified customers fixed-term loans and revolving credit lines for the purchase of products and services offered by the Company.  Financing income attributable to these loans is recognized in products net revenue on an accrual basis.  
    
  Disaggregation of Revenue     The Company's revenue is presented on a disaggregated basis on the   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss)   and in   Note 18   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   based on an evaluation of disclosures outside of the financial statements, information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker for evaluating the financial performance of operating segments, and other information that is used to evaluate the Company's financial performance or make resource allocations.  This information includes revenue from products and services, revenue from reportable segments, and revenue by major product categories within the segments.  
    
  Contract Assets     Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Company has transferred to a customer when such a right is conditional on something other than the passage of time.  Such amounts have been insignificant to date.  
    
  Contract Liabilities     Contract liabilities primarily consist of deferred revenue.  Deferred revenue is recorded when the Company has a right to invoice or payments have been received for undelivered products or services, or in situations where revenue recognition criteria have not been met.  Deferred revenue also represents amounts received in advance for extended warranty services and software maintenance.  Revenue is recognized on these items when the revenue recognition criteria are met, generally resulting in ratable recognition over the contract term.  The Company also has deferred revenue related to undelivered hardware and professional services, consisting of installations and consulting engagements, which are recognized as the Company's performance obligations under the contract are completed.  See   Note 9   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information about deferred revenue.   
    
  Costs to Obtain a Contract         The incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract primarily consist of sales commissions and employer taxes related to commission payments.  The Company has elected, as a practical expedient, to expense as incurred costs to obtain a contract equal to or less than one year in duration.  For contracts greater than one year in duration, the associated costs to obtain a contract are deferred and amortized over the period of contract performance or a longer period, generally the estimated life of the customer relationship, if renewals are expected and the renewal commission is not commensurate with the initial commission.  Deferred costs to obtain a contract are typically amortized over a period of   three   to   seven   years, depending on the contract term and expectation of the period of benefit for the costs, which may exceed the contract term.  Amortization expense is recognized on a straight-line basis and included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss)  .  The Company periodically reviews these deferred costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the carrying value or period of

benefit of the deferred sales commissions.  There were no material impairment losses for deferred sales commissions during the   six months ended August 3, 2018 and August 4, 2017  . 
    
  Deferred costs to obtain a contract as of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018   were   $1.0 billion   and   $0.8 billion  , respectively.  Deferred costs to obtain a contract are classified as current assets and other non-current assets on the Condensed   Consolidated Statements of Financial Position  , based on when the expense is expected to be recognized.  Amortization of costs to obtain a contract during the three months ended   August 3, 2018   and   August 4, 2017   was   $113 million   and   $62 million  , respectively.  Amortization of costs to obtain a contract during the six months ended   August 3, 2018   and   August 4, 2017   was   $219 million   and   $115 million  , respectively.

NOTE 3       FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  The following table presents the Company's hierarchy for its assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  : 

____________________ 
  (a)       The Company did not transfer any securities between levels during the   six months ended August 3, 2018  . 
    
  The following section describes the valuation methodologies the Company uses to measure financial instruments at fair value: 
    
  Money Market Funds       The Company's investment in money market funds that are classified as cash equivalents hold underlying investments with a weighted average maturity of     90     days   or less and are recognized at fair value.  The valuations of these securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, when available, or pricing models whereby all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data.  The Company reviews   security pricing and assesses liquidity on a quarterly basis.      As of   August 3, 2018  , the Company's U.S. portfolio had no material exposure to money market funds with a fluctuating net asset value. 
    
  Equity and Other Securities     The majority of the Company's investments in equity and other securities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of strategic investments in publicly-traded companies.    The valuation of these securities is based on quoted prices in active markets. 
    
  Debt Securities     The majority of the Company's debt securities consists of various fixed income securities such as U.S. government and agencies, U.S. corporate, and foreign.  Valuation is based on pricing models whereby all significant inputs,  

22 

Table of Contents

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (unaudited) 

including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issue spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and other market related data, are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset.  Inputs are documented in accordance with the fair value measurements hierarchy.  The Company reviews security pricing and assesses liquidity on a quarterly basis.  See   Note 4   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information about investments. 
    
  Derivative Instruments     The Company's derivative financial instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward and purchased option contracts and interest rate swaps.  The fair value of the portfolio is determined using valuation models based on market observable inputs, including interest rate curves, forward and spot prices for currencies, and implied volatilities.  Credit risk is also factored into the fair value calculation of the Company's derivative instrument portfolio.  See   Note 7   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for a description of the Company's derivative financial instrument activities. 
    
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis     Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the recurring fair value table above.  These assets consist primarily of non-financial assets such as goodwill and intangible assets.  See   Note 8   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets. 
    
  As of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , the Company held strategic investments of   $582 million   and   $485 million  , respectively.  As these investments represent early-stage companies without readily determinable fair values, they are not included in the recurring fair value table above. 
    
  The Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative for these investments.  Under the alternative, the Company measures investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, adjusted by observable price changes.  The Company must make a separate election to use the alternative for each eligible investment and is required to reassess at each reporting period whether an investment qualifies for the alternative.  In evaluating these investments for impairment or observable price changes, the Company uses inputs including pre- and post-money valuations of recent financing events and the impact of those on its fully diluted ownership percentages, as well as other available information regarding the issuer's historical and forecasted performance. 
    
  Carrying Value and Estimated Fair Value of Outstanding Debt     The following table summarizes the carrying value and estimated fair value of the Company's outstanding debt as described in   Note 6   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  , including the current portion, as of the dates indicated: 

The fair values of the outstanding debt shown in the table above, as well as the DFS debt described in   Note 5   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  , were determined based on observable market prices in a less active market or based on valuation methodologies using observable inputs and were categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value of DFS debt approximates carrying value.

NOTE 4         INVESTMENTS    
    
  The following table summarizes, by major security type, the carrying value and amortized cost of the Company's investments.  All debt security investments with remaining effective maturities in excess of one year and substantially all equity and other securities are recorded as long-term investments in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.    

  ____________________ 
           (a)  
    $582 million   and   $485 million   of equity and other securities as of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , respectively, are strategic investments without readily determinable fair values, which are recorded at cost, less impairment, and adjusted for observable price changes.  The remainder are publicly-traded investments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  See   Note 3   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information on investments measured at fair value. 
       
  The Company's investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale securities, which are carried at fair value.      As of     August 3, 2018  , the aggregate fair value of investments held in a continuous unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months was   $1.5 billion  , and the unrealized loss on these investments was   $25 million  .  As of   February 2, 2018  , the aggregate fair value of investments held in a continuous unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months was   $1.9 billion  , and the unrealized loss on these investments was   $25 million  . 
    
  The maturities of debt securities held as of   August 3, 2018   are as follows:

NOTE 5       FINANCIAL SERVICES 
    
  The Company offers or arranges various financing options and services for its customers in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand through Dell Financial Services and its affiliates ("DFS").  The key activities of DFS include originating, collecting, and servicing customer receivables primarily related to the purchase of Dell Technologies products and services.  In some cases, DFS also offers financing on the purchase of third-party technology products that complement the Dell Technologies portfolio of products and services.  New financing originations were   $1.9 billion   and   $1.6 billion   for the   three months ended August 3, 2018 and August 4, 2017  , respectively, and were   $3.6 billion   and   $2.7 billion   for the   six months ended August 3, 2018 and August 4, 2017  , respectively.  
    
  Financing Receivables 
    
  The Company's financing receivables are aggregated into the following categories: 

Revolving loans     Revolving loans offered under private label credit financing programs provide qualified customers with a revolving credit line for the purchase of products and services offered by Dell Technologies.  These private label credit financing programs are referred to as Dell Preferred Account ("DPA") and Dell Business Credit ("DBC").  The DPA product is primarily offered to individual consumer customers, and the DBC product is primarily offered to small and medium-sized commercial customers.  Revolving loans in the United States bear interest at a variable annual percentage rate that is tied to the prime rate.  Based on historical payment patterns, revolving loan transactions are typically repaid within   twelve months   on average. 

Fixed-term sales-type leases and loans     The Company enters into sales-type lease arrangements with customers who seek lease financing.  Leases with business customers have fixed terms of generally   two   to   four years  .      Future maturities of minimum lease and associated financing payments as of     August 3, 2018     were as follows:      Fiscal 2019     -     $1,335 million  ;   Fiscal 2020   -   $1,932 million  ;   Fiscal 2021   -   $1,203 million  ;   Fiscal 2022   -   $462 million  ;   Fiscal 2023 and beyond   -   $153 million  .      Future maturities and associated financing payments referenced herein represent the aggregate payments under the customer lease contract.  The Company also offers fixed-term loans to qualified small businesses, large commercial accounts, governmental organizations, educational entities, and certain individual consumer customers.  These loans are repaid in equal payments including interest and have defined terms of generally   three   to   five years  . 
       
  The following table summarizes the components of the Company's financing receivables segregated by portfolio segment as of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  :

The following tables present the allowance for financing receivable losses for the three months ended August 3, 2018 and August 4, 2017, and the six months ended August 3, 2018 and August 4, 2017, and changes in allowance for financing receivable losses for the respective periods: 

The following table summarizes the aging of the Company's customer financing receivables, gross, including accrued interest, as of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , segregated by class: 

Aging is likely to fluctuate quarter to quarter as a result of the variability in volume of large transactions entered into over the period, and the administrative processes that accompany those larger transactions.  As such, fluctuations in aging do not necessarily indicate a material change in the credit quality of the portfolio.

Credit Quality 
    
  The following table summarizes customer receivables, gross, including accrued interest, by credit quality indicator segregated by class, as of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  .  The categories shown in the table below segregate customer receivables based on the relative degrees of credit risk.  The credit quality indicators for DPA revolving accounts are measured primarily as of each quarter-end date, while all other indicators are generally updated on a periodic basis. 
    
  For DPA revolving receivables shown in the table below, the Company makes credit decisions based on proprietary scorecards, which include the customer's credit history, payment history, credit usage, and other credit agency-related elements.  The higher quality category includes prime accounts generally of a higher credit quality that are comparable to U.S. customer FICO scores of   720   or above.  The mid-category represents the mid-tier accounts that are comparable to U.S. customer FICO scores from   660   to   719  .  The lower category is generally sub-prime and represents lower credit quality accounts that are comparable to U.S. customer FICO scores below   660  .  For the DBC revolving receivables and fixed-term commercial receivables shown in the table below, an internal grading system is utilized that assigns a credit level score based on a number of considerations, including liquidity, operating performance, and industry outlook.  The grading criteria and classifications for the fixed-term products differ from those for the revolving products as loss experience varies between these product and customer groups.  The credit quality categories cannot be compared between the different classes as loss experience varies substantially between the classes.

DFS Debt 
    
  The Company maintains programs that facilitate the funding of financing receivables in the capital markets. The following table summarizes DFS debt as of the periods indicated.  The table excludes the allocated portion of the Company's other borrowings, which represents the additional amount considered to fund the DFS business. 

DFS U.S. Debt 
    
  Securitization Facilities         The Company maintains separate securitization facilities in the United States for fixed-term leases and loans and revolving loans.  This debt is collateralized solely by the U.S. financing receivables in the facilities.  The debt has a variable interest rate and the duration of this debt is based on the terms of the underlying financing receivables.  As of   August 3, 2018  , the total debt capacity related to the U.S. securitization facilities was   $3.5 billion  .  The Company enters into interest swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of its securitization debt from a floating rate to a fixed rate.  See   Note 7   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   for additional information about interest rate swaps. 
    
  The Company's U.S. securitization facility for revolving loans is effective through June 1, 2020.  The Company's two U.S. securitization facilities for fixed-term leases and loans are effective through February 10, 2020 and February 22, 2020. 
    
  The securitization facilities contain standard structural features related to the performance of the securitized receivables, which include defined credit losses, delinquencies, average credit scores, and minimum collection requirements.  In the event one or more of these criteria are not met and the Company is unable to restructure the facility, no further funding of receivables will be permitted and the timing of the Company's expected cash flows from over-collateralization will be delayed.  As of   August 3, 2018  , these criteria were met. 
    
  Fixed-Term Securitization Offerings         The Company periodically issues asset-backed debt securities under fixed-term securitization programs to private investors.  The asset-backed debt securities are collateralized solely by the U.S. fixed-term financing receivables in the offerings, which are held by Special Purpose Entities ("SPEs"), as discussed below.  The interest rate on these securities is fixed and ranges from   0.85%   to   3.85%   per annum, and the duration of these securities is based on the terms of the underlying financing receivables. 
    
  DFS International Debt 
    
  Securitization Facility         The Company maintains a securitization facility in Europe for fixed-term leases and loans.  This facility is effective through January 13, 2019.  As of   August 3, 2018  , the total debt capacity related to the international securitization facility was     $695 million  .

The securitization facility contains standard structural features related to the performance of the securitized receivables which include defined credit losses, delinquencies, average credit scores, and minimum collection requirements.  In the event one or more of these criteria are not met and the Company is unable to restructure the program, no further funding of   receivables will be permitted and the timing of the Company's expected cash flows from over-collateralization will be delayed.  As of     August 3, 2018  , these criteria were met. 
    
  Other Structured Facilities         In connection with the Company's international financing operations, the Company has entered into revolving structured financing debt programs related to its fixed-term lease and loan products sold in Canada, Europe, Au  stralia, and New Zealand.  The Canadian facility, which is collateralized solely by Canadian financing receivables, had a total debt capacity of     $192 million     as of     August 3, 2018  , and is effective through January 16, 2023.  The European facility, which is collateralized solely by European financing receivables, had a total debt capacity of     $463 million     as   of   August 3, 2018  , and is effective through December 14, 2020.  The Australia and New Zealand facility, which is collateralized solely by the Australia and New Zealand financing receivables, had a total debt capacity of   $88 million   as of   August 3, 2018  , and is effective through January 29, 2020. 
    
  Note Payable       On November 27, 2017, the Company entered into an unsecured credit agreement to fund receivables in Mexico.  As of   August 3, 2018  , the aggregate principal amount of the note payable is   $200 million  .  The note bears interest at either the applicable London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus   2.25%  , for the borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars, or the Mexican Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate ("TIIE") plus   2.00%  , for the borrowings denominated in Mexican pesos.  The note will mature on December 1, 2020.  Although the note is unsecured, the Company intends to manage the note in the same manner as its structured financing programs, so that the collections from financing receivables in Mexico will be used to pay down principal and interest of the note. 
    
  Variable Interest Entities 
    
  In connection with the securitization facilities and offerings discussed above, the Company transfers certain U.S. and European customer financing receivables to SPEs that meet the definition of a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE") and are consolidated, along with the associated debt, into the Consolidated Financial Statements, as the Company is the primary beneficiary of those VIEs.  The SPEs are bankruptcy-remote legal entities with separate assets and liabilities.  The purpose of the SPEs is to facilitate the funding of customer receivables in the capital markets. 
    
  The following table shows financing receivables held by the consolidated VIEs as of the respective dates: 

Financing receivables transferred via securitization through SPEs were   $1.2 billion   and   $1.0 billion   for the   three months ended August 3, 2018 and August 4, 2017  , respectively, and   $2.5 billion   and   $1.9 billion   for the   six months ended August 3, 2018 and August 4, 2017  , respectively. 
    
  Some of the SPEs have entered into financing arrangements with multi-seller conduits that, in turn, issue asset-backed debt securities in the capital markets.  The DFS debt outstanding, which is collateralized by the financing receivables held by the consolidated VIEs, was   $4.6 billion   and   $3.9 billion   as of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , respectively.  The Company's risk of loss related to securitized receivables is limited to the amount by which the Company's right to receive collections for assets securitized exceeds the amount required to pay interest, principal, and fees and expenses related to the asset-backed securities.  The Company provides credit enhancement to the securitization in the form of over-collateralization.

Additionally, during the six months ended August 3, 2018, the Company issued an additional   $868 million  , net, in DFS debt to support the expansion of its financing receivables portfolio. 
    
  Secured Debt 
    
  Senior Secured Credit Facilities           The Company has entered into a credit agreement that provides for senior secured credit facilities (the "Senior Secured Credit Facilities") in the aggregate principal amount of   $17.6 billion   comprising (a) term loan facilities and (b) a senior secured Revolving Credit Facility, which includes capacity for up to   $0.5 billion   of letters of credit and for borrowings of up to   $0.4 billion   under swing-line loans.  As of   August 3, 2018  , available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility totaled   $3.3 billion  .  The Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide that the borrowers have the right at any time, subject to customary conditions, to request incremental term loans or incremental revolving commitments. 
    
  Borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin, plus, at the borrowers' option, either (a) a base rate, which, under the Term Loan B Facility, is subject to an interest rate floor of   1.75%   per annum, and under all other borrowings is subject to an interest rate floor of   0%   per annum, or (b) a London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR"), which, under the Term Loan B Facility, is subject to an interest rate floor of   0.75%   per annum, and under all other borrowings is subject to an interest rate floor of   0%   per annum.  Interest is payable, in the case of loans bearing interest based on LIBOR, at the end of each interest period (but at least every three months), in arrears and, in the case of loans bearing interest based on the base rate, quarterly in arrears. 
    
  The Term Loan A-2 Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to   5%   of the original principal amount in the first year after the closing date of the refinancing transaction on October 20, 2017,   10%   of the original principal amount in each of the second and third years after October 20, 2017, and   70%   of the original principal amount in the fourth year after October 20, 2017.  The Term Loan B Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to   1%   of the original principal amount.  The Term Loan A-3 Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility have no amortization.  The Term Loan A-3 Facility requires the borrowers to prepay outstanding borrowings under these facilities with   100%   of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or dispositions.  The borrowers may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the term loan facilities and the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary "breakage" costs. 
    
  All obligations of the borrowers under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and certain swap agreements, cash management arrangements, and certain letters of credit provided by any lender or agent party to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any of its affiliates and certain other persons are secured by (a) a first-priority security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets of the borrowers and the guarantors and (b) a first-priority pledge of   100%   of the capital stock of the borrowers, Dell Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (  "  Dell  "  ), and each wholly-owned material restricted subsidiary of the borrowers and the guarantors, in each case subject to certain thresholds, exceptions, and permitted liens.

other distributions in respect of capital stock or make other restricted payments, make certain investments, sell or transfer certain assets, create liens on certain assets to secure debt, consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, and designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.

NOTE 7       DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES    
    
  Derivative Instruments 
    
  As part of its risk management strategy, the Company uses derivative instruments, primarily foreign currency forward and option contracts and interest rate swaps, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures, respectively. 
    
  The Company's objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts used to hedge the exposures, thereby reducing volatility of earnings and protecting the fair values of assets and liabilities.  The earnings effects of the derivative instruments are presented in the same income statement line items as the earnings effects of the hedged items.  For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the Company assesses hedge effectiveness both at the onset of the hedge and at regular intervals throughout the life of the derivative.  The Company does not have any derivatives designated as fair value hedges. 
    
  Foreign Exchange Risk 
    
  The Company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  Hedge accounting is applied based upon the criteria established by accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  The risk of loss associated with purchased options is limited to premium amounts paid for the option contracts.  The risk of loss associated with forward contracts is equal to the exchange rate differential from the time the contract is entered into until the time it is settled.  The majority of these contracts typically expire in   twelve months   or less. 
    
  During the   six months ended August 3, 2018 and August 4, 2017  , the Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedges related to foreign exchange contracts that had a material impact on the Company's results of operations due to the probability that the forecasted cash flows would not occur. 
    
  The Company uses forward contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency.  These contracts generally expire in   three months   or less, are considered economic hedges, and are not designated for hedge accounting.  The change in the fair value of these instruments represents a natural hedge as their gains and losses offset the changes in the underlying fair value of the monetary assets and liabilities due to movements in currency exchange rates. 
    
  In connection with the expanded offerings of DFS in Europe, forward contracts are used to hedge financing receivables denominated in foreign currencies.  These contracts are not designated for hedge accounting and most expire within   three years   or less. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash flows related to the interest rate payments on structured financing debt.  The interest rate swaps economically convert the variable rate on the structured financing debt to a fixed interest rate to match the underlying fixed rate being received on fixed-term customer leases and loans.  These contracts are not designated for hedge accounting and most expire within   three years   or less. 
    
  Interest rate swaps are utilized to manage the interest rate risk, at a portfolio level, associated with DFS operations in Europe.  The interest rate swaps economically convert the fixed rate on financing receivables to a three-month Euribor floating rate basis in order to match the floating rate nature of the banks' funding pool.  These contracts are not designated for hedge accounting and most expire within   three years   or less. 
    
  The Company utilizes cross currency amortizing swaps to hedge the currency and interest rate risk exposure associated with the securitization program that was established in Europe in January 2017.  The cross currency swaps combine a Euro-based interest rate swap with a British Pound or U.S. Dollar foreign exchange forward contract in which the Company pays a fixed British Pound or U.S. Dollar amount and receives a floating amount in Euro linked to the one-month Euribor.  The notional value of the swaps amortizes in line with the expected cash flows and run-off of the securitized assets.  The swaps mature within   five years   or less and are not designated for hedge accounting.

NOTE 8       GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  The following table presents goodwill allocated to the Company's business segments as of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , and changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the respective periods: 

____________________ 
           (a) 
    Infrastructure Solutions Group is composed of the Core Storage, Servers, and Networking goodwill reporting unit. 
              (b) 
    Other Businesses consists of offerings by Pivotal, SecureWorks, RSA Security LLC ("RSA Security"), Virtustream Group Holdings, Inc. ("Virtustream"), and Boomi, Inc. ("Boomi"). 
              (c) 
    During the three months ended May 4, 2018, the Company made certain segment reporting changes, which included the movement of the results of Virtustream from the Infrastructure Solutions Group segment to Other businesses.  The amount of goodwill attributable to Virtustream was reclassified to Other businesses to align with these reporting changes. 
       
  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter and whenever events or circumstances may indicate that an impairment has occurred.  Based on the results of the annual impairment test, which was a quantitative test for certain goodwill reporting units and a qualitative test for others, no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed for any reporting unit as of   November 3, 2017  .  As a result of this analysis, it was determined that the excess of fair value over carrying amount was greater than   20%   for all of the Company's existing goodwill reporting units as of   November 3, 2017  , with the exception of the Core Storage, Servers, and Networking goodwill reporting unit within the Infrastructure Solutions Group segment, which had an excess of fair value over carrying amount of   18%   as of such date.  Management will continue to monitor the Core Storage, Servers, and Networking goodwill reporting unit and consider potential impacts to the impairment assessment.  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were assessed during the three months ended May 4, 2018 to consider the impact of segment reporting changes.  No indications of impairment were identified as a result of these changes.  The Company did not have any accumulated goodwill impairment charges as of   August 3, 2018  . 
    
  Management exercised significant judgment related to the above assessment, including the identification of goodwill reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to goodwill reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit.  The fair value of each goodwill reporting unit is generally estimated using a combination of public company multiples and discounted cash flow methodologies.  This analysis requires significant judgment, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, the estimation of the long-term growth rate of the Company's business, and the determination of the Company's weighted average cost of capital.  Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the fair value of the goodwill reporting unit, potentially resulting in a non-cash impairment charge.

Intangible Assets 
    
  The Company's intangible assets as of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018   were as follows: 

Amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets was approximately   $1.5 billion   and   $1.7 billion   for the   three months ended August 3, 2018 and August 4, 2017  , respectively, and   $3.0 billion   and   $3.5 billion   during the   six months ended August 3, 2018 and August 4, 2017  , respectively.  The amortization expense for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2018 was primarily related to the intangible assets acquired in the EMC merger transaction.  There were   no   material impairment charges related to intangible assets during the   three months ended August 3, 2018 and August 4, 2017  . 
    
  Estimated future annual pre-tax amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets as of   August 3, 2018   over the next five fiscal years and thereafter is as follows:

NOTE 9       DEFERRED REVENUE    
    
  Deferred Revenue       Deferred revenue is recorded for support and deployment services, software maintenance, professional services, training, and SaaS when the Company has a right to invoice or payments have been received for undelivered products or services where transfer of control has not occurred.  Revenue is recognized on these items when the revenue recognition criteria are met, generally resulting in ratable recognition over the contract term.  The Company also has deferred revenue related to undelivered hardware and professional services, consisting of installations and consulting engagements, which are recognized as the Company's performance obligations under the contract are completed. 
    
  Changes in the Company's deferred revenue are presented in     the following table for the period indicated: 

____________________ 
           (a) 
    Includes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
       
  Remaining Performance Obligations     Remaining performance obligations represent the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations not delivered, or partially undelivered, as of the end of the reporting period.  
  Remaining performance obligations include deferred revenue plus unbilled amounts not yet recorded in deferred revenue.  The aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations does not include amounts owed under cancelable contracts where there is no substantive termination penalty. 
    
  The Company applied the practical expedient to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice for services performed.  The Company also applied the practical expedient to not disclose the amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for the periods prior to adoption of the new revenue standard. 
    
  Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidation, adjustments for revenue that has not materialized, and adjustments for currency. 
    
  The value of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations as of   August 3, 2018   was approximately   $29 billion  .  The Company expects to recognize approximately   62%   of remaining performance obligations as revenue in the next   12   months, and the remainder thereafter.

NOTE 11       COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    
    
  Legal Matters 
    
  The Company is involved in various claims, suits, assessments, investigations, and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, including those identified below, consisting of matters involving consumer, antitrust, tax, intellectual property, and other issues on a global basis.  The Company accrues a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss.  The Company reviews these accruals at least quarterly and adjusts them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other relevant information.  To the extent new information is obtained and the Company's views on the probable outcomes of claims, suits, assessments, investigations, or legal proceedings change, changes in the Company's accrued liabilities would be recorded in the period in which such a determination is made.  For some matters, the amount of liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore accruals have not been made.  The following is a discussion of the Company's significant legal matters and other proceedings: 
    
  Appraisal Proceedings     On October 29, 2013, Dell Technologies acquired Dell in a transaction referred to as the going-private transaction.  Holders of shares of Dell common stock who did not vote on September 12, 2013 in favor of the proposal to adopt the amended going-private transaction agreement and who properly demanded appraisal of their shares and who otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporate Law ("DGCL") are entitled to seek appraisal for, and obtain payment in cash for the judicially determined "fair value" (as defined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL) of, their shares in lieu of receiving the going-private transaction consideration.  Dell initially recorded a liability of   $13.75   for each share with respect to which appraisal has been demanded and as to which the demand has not been withdrawn, together with interest at the statutory rate discussed below.  The Court of Chancery ruled that the fair value of the appraisal shares as of October 29, 2013, the date on which the going-private transaction became effective, was   $17.62   per share.  This ruling would entitle the holders of the remaining   5,505,630   shares subject to the appraisal proceedings to   $17.62   per share, plus interest at a statutory rate, compounded quarterly.  On November 21, 2016, the Court of Chancery entered final judgment in the appraisal action.  On November 22, 2016, Dell filed a notice of appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court, which issued a decision on December 14, 2017.  In its decision, the Delaware Supreme Court reversed, in part, and affirmed, in part, the decision of the Delaware Court of Chancery.  On January 2, 2018, the Delaware Supreme Court issued its formal mandate remanding the matter to the Court of Chancery for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.  In accordance with direction by the Court of Chancery, the parties submitted proposals to the Court of Chancery outlining the remaining issues to be adjudicated.  The liability for the appraisal proceedings was approximately   $129 million   as of   February 2, 2018  .  On   May 8, 2018  , the Company entered into an agreement to settle a portion of the liability related to the appraisal proceedings in the amount of approximately   $70 million  , and on May 18, 2018, this portion of the liability was fully paid.  The Company settled with the remaining plaintiffs as of July 16, 2018 in the amount of approximately   $30 million  .  The remaining liability accrual was released to Interest and other, net during the   three months ended August 3, 2018  .  As of   August 3, 2018  , there was no remaining liability for appraisal proceedings.    
    
  Securities Litigation     On May 22, 2014, a securities class action seeking compensatory damages was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned the City of Pontiac Employee Retirement     System vs. Dell Inc. et. al. (Case No. 1:14-cv-03644).  The action names as defendants Dell Inc. and certain current and former executive officers, and alleges that Dell made false and misleading statements about Dell's business operations and products between February 22, 2012 and May 22, 2012, which resulted in artificially inflated stock prices.  The case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, where the defendants filed a motion to dismiss.  On September 16, 2016, the Court denied the motion to dismiss and the case is proceeding with discovery.  The defendants believe the claims asserted are without merit and the risk of material loss is remote. 
    
  Copyright Levies     The Company's obligation to collect and remit copyright levies in certain European Union ("EU") countries may be affected by the resolution of legal proceedings pending in Germany and other EU member states against various companies, including Dell subsidiaries.  The plaintiffs in those proceedings generally seek to impose or modify the levies with respect to sales of such equipment as multifunction devices, phones, personal computers, storage devices, and printers, alleging that such products enable the copying of copyrighted materials.  Some of the proceedings also challenge whether the levy schemes in those countries comply with EU law.  Certain EU member  

45 

Table of Contents  
  DELL TECHNOLOGIES INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (unaudited) 

countries that do not yet impose levies on digital devices are expected to implement legislation to enable them to extend existing levy schemes, while some other EU member countries are expected to limit the scope of levy schemes and their applicability in the digital hardware environment.  Dell, other companies, and various industry associations have opposed the extension of levies to the digital environment and have advocated alternative models of compensation to rights holders.  The Company continues to collect levies in certain EU countries where it has determined that based on local laws it is probable that it has a payment obligation.  The amount of levies is generally based on the number of products sold and the per-product amounts of the levies, which vary.  The Company accrues a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and when it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. 
    
  Other Litigation     The various legal proceedings in which Dell is involved include commercial litigation and a variety of patent suits.  In some of these cases, Dell is the sole defendant.  More often, particularly in the patent suits, Dell is one of a number of defendants in the electronics and technology industries.  Dell is actively defending a number of patent infringement suits, and several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation.  While the number of patent cases varies over time, Dell does not currently anticipate that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  As of   August 3, 2018  , the Company does not believe there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss exceeding the amounts already accrued for these or other proceedings or matters has been incurred.  However, since the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings and matters is inherently unpredictable, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected in any particular period by unfavorable outcomes in one or more of these proceedings or matters.  Whether the outcome of any claim, suit, assessment, investigation, or legal proceeding, individually or collectively, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including the nature, timing, and amount of any associated expenses, amounts paid in settlement, damages, or other remedies or consequences. 
    
  Indemnifications 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under which it may agree to indemnify the third party to such arrangements from any losses incurred relating to the services it performs on behalf of the Company or for losses arising from certain events as defined in the particular contract, such as litigation or claims relating to past performance.  Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses.  Historically, payments related to these indemnifications have not been material to the Company.

NOTE 12       INCOME AND OTHER TAXES 
    
  For the   three months ended August 3, 2018 and August 4, 2017  , the Company's effective income tax rates were   1.5%   and   38.9%  , respectively, on pre-tax losses of   $0.5 billion   and   $1.2 billion  , respectively.  For the   six months ended August 3, 2018 and August 4, 2017  , the Company's effective income tax rates were   8.4%   and   36.4%  , respectively, on pre-tax losses of   $1.1 billion   and   $3.1 billion  , respectively.  The changes in the Company's effective income tax rates for the three and six months ended   August 3, 2018   compared to the prior periods were primarily attributable to impacts of U.S. Tax Reform.  The change in the Company's effective income tax rate for the six months ended   August 3, 2018   was also impacted by discrete tax benefits resulting from the impact of adopting the new revenue standard. 
    
  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("U.S. Tax Reform" or the "Act") was signed into law on December 22, 2017.  Among other things, U.S. Tax Reform lowers the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%, establishes a modified territorial system requiring a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the "Transition Tax"), requires a minimum tax on certain future earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries while providing for future tax-free repatriation of earnings through a 100% dividends-received deduction, and places limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense. 
    
  GAAP requires the effect of a change in tax laws to be recognized in the period that includes the enactment date.  Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"), which allows companies to record provisional amounts in earnings for the first year following the Act's enactment, with those provisional amounts required to be finalized by the end of that year.  In accordance with GAAP and SAB 118, for the   fiscal year ended February 2, 2018  , the Company recognized a provisional tax benefit of   $0.5 billion  , which was primarily driven by a   $1.5 billion   tax benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, offset by   $1.0 billion   of current and future income tax expenses related to the Transition Tax.  The Company s provisional estimates for the Transition Tax are based on its initial analysis using available information and estimates.  In accordance with SAB 118, the Company s provisional benefit will be adjusted once the analysis is complete, but no later than the fourth quarter of the   fiscal year ending February 1, 2019  .  The Company continues to collect and process the data necessary to complete the analysis.  In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department issued proposed regulations as guidance for the Transition Tax on August 1, 2018.  The Company is also evaluating the impact of this guidance on the calculation of its provisional benefit.  As a result, no adjustments have been made to the provisional amount recorded for the   fiscal year ended February 2, 2018  .  Revisions to the Company s provisional estimates may be material to the Company.  Any final guidance to be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department also could further affect the provisional calculation.  Additionally, when the Company files its U.S. tax return for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2018, any changes to the tax positions for temporary differences compared to the estimates used for the provisional estimate will result in an adjustment of the estimated tax benefit recorded as of February 2, 2018.  
    
  The differences between the estimated effective income tax rates and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% principally result from the Company's geographical distribution of income and differences between the book and tax treatment of certain items.  In certain jurisdictions, the Company's tax rate is significantly less than the applicable statutory rate as a result of tax holidays.  The majority of the Company's foreign income that is subject to these tax holidays and lower tax rates is attributable to Singapore, China, and Malaysia.  A significant portion of these income tax benefits is related to a tax holiday that will expire at the end of the   fiscal year ending February 1, 2019  .  The Company is currently seeking new terms for the affected subsidiary beyond the   fiscal year ending February 1, 2019  , and it is uncertain whether any terms will be agreed upon.  The Company's other tax holidays will expire in whole or in part during fiscal years 2019 through 2023.  Many of these tax holidays and reduced tax rates may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. 
    
  The Company's U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2007 through 2009 are currently under consideration by the Office of Appeals of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS").  The IRS issued a Revenue Agent's Report ("RAR") related to those years during the fiscal year ended February 3, 2017.  The IRS has proposed adjustments primarily relating to transfer pricing matters with which the Company disagrees and is contesting through the IRS administrative appeals process.  In May 2017, the IRS commenced a federal income tax audit for fiscal years 2010 through 2014, which could take several years to complete.   
    
  Prior to the EMC merger transaction, EMC received a RAR for its tax years 2009 and 2010.  On May 5, 2017, EMC received an RAR for its tax year 2011.  The Company has been contesting certain adjustments proposed in these RARs through the IRS administrative appeals process and, during the three months ended August 3, 2018, reached an agreement on the contested issues with the IRS.  The terms are not material to the Company s results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

The Company is also currently under income tax audits in various state and foreign jurisdictions.  The Company is undergoing negotiations, and in some cases contested proceedings, relating to tax matters with the taxing authorities in these jurisdictions.  The Company believes that it has provided adequate reserves related to all matters contained in tax periods open to examination.  Although the Company believes it has made adequate provisions for the uncertainties surrounding these audits, should the Company experience unfavorable outcomes, such outcomes could have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  With respect to major U.S. state and foreign taxing jurisdictions, the Company is generally not subject to tax examinations for years prior to the fiscal year ended February 2, 2007. 
    
  Judgment is required in evaluating the Com  pany's uncertain tax positions and determining the Company's provision for income taxes.  The unrecognized tax benefits were     $3.3 billion     and     $3.2 billion     as of     August 3, 2018     and     February 2, 2018  , respectively, and are included in other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  The Company does not anticipate a significant change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 
    
  The Company takes certain non-income tax positions in the jurisdictions in which it operates and has received certain non-income tax assessments from various jurisdictions.  The Company believes that a material loss in these matters is not probable and that it is not reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding amounts already accrued has been incurred.  The Company believes its positions in these non-income tax litigation matters are supportable and that it ultimately will prevail in the matters.  In the normal course of business, the Company's positions and conclusions related to its non-income taxes could be challenged and assessments may be made.  To the extent new information is obtained and the Company's views on its positions, probable outcomes of assessments, or litigation change, changes in estimates to the Company's accrued liabilities would be recorded in the period in which such a determination is made.  In the resolution process for income tax and non-income tax audits, in certain situations the Company is required to provide collateral guarantees or indemnification to regulators and tax authorities until the matter is resolved.

NOTE 14         NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS 
    
  VMware, Inc.     The non-controlling interests' share of equity in VMware, Inc. is reflected as a component of the non-controlling interests in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and was   $5.6 billion   and   $5.2 billion   as of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , respectively.  As of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , the Company held approximately   81.1%   and   81.9%  , respectively, of the outstanding equity interest in VMware, Inc. 
    
  Pivotal     On April 24, 2018, Pivotal completed a registered underwritten IPO of its Class A common stock.  In conjunction with the IPO, all of Pivotal's preferred equity shares were converted into shares of its common stock on a   one  -to-one basis, such that upon completion of its IPO, Pivotal's outstanding capital stock consisted solely of common stock.  The non-controlling interests' share of equity in Pivotal is reflected as a component of the non-controlling interest in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and was   $921 million   and   $489 million   as of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , respectively.  The increase in non-controlling interest for Pivotal is primarily due to the IPO completed during the three months ended   May 4, 2018  .  As of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , the Company held approximately   64.9%   and   77.1%  , respectively, of the outstanding equity interest in Pivotal. 
    
  SecureWorks     The non-controlling interests' share of equity in SecureWorks is reflected as a component of the non-controlling interests in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and was   $96 million   and   $90 million   as of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , respectively.  As of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , the Company held approximately   86.5%   and   87.1%  , respectively, of the outstanding equity interest in SecureWorks, excluding restricted stock awards ("RSAs").  As of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , the Company held approximately   85.6%   and   86.3%  , respectively, of the outstanding equity interest in SecureWorks, including RSAs.

NOTE 15       EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE 
    
  Basic earnings (loss) per share is based on the weighted-average effect of all common shares issued and outstanding and is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares used in the basic earnings (loss) per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive instruments.  The Company excludes equity instruments from the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share if the effect of including such instruments is antidilutive. 
    
  The Company has   two   groups of common stock, denoted as the DHI Group Common Stock and the Class V Common Stock.  The DHI Group Common Stock consists of   four   classes of common stock, referred to as Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, Class C Common Stock, and Class D Common Stock.  The DHI Group generally refers to the direct and indirect interest of Dell Technologies in all of Del  l Technologies' business, assets, properties, liabilities, and preferred stock other than those attributable to the Class V Group, as well as the DHI Group's retained interest in the Class V Group equal to approximately     39%     of the Company's     economic interest in the Class V Group as of   August 3, 2018  .  The Class V Common Stock is intended to track the economic performance of approximately   61%   of the Company's economic interest in the Class V Group as of such date.  The Class V Group consists solely of VMware, Inc. common stock held by the Company.  As of   August 3, 2018  , the Class V Group consisted of approximately   331 million   share  s of VMware, Inc. common stock.      See   Note 16   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   and Exhibit 99.1 filed with the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended   August 3, 2018   for more information regarding the allocation of earnings from Dell Technologies' interest in VMware, Inc. between the DHI Group and the Class V Common Stock. 
    
  For purposes of calculating earnings (loss) per share, the Company used the two-class method.  As all classes of DHI Group Common Stock share the same rights in dividends, basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same for each class of DHI Group Common Stock. 
    
  The following table sets forth basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for each of the periods presented:

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for each of the periods presented: 

____________________ 
           (a) 
    The incremental dilution from VMware, Inc. represents the impact of VMware, Inc.'s dilutive securities on the diluted earnings (loss) per share of the DHI Group and the Class V Common Stock, respectively, and is calculated by multiplying the difference between VMware, Inc.'s basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share by the number of shares of VMware, Inc. common stock held by the Company. 
              (b) 
    The dilutive effect of Class V Common Stock-based incentive awards was not material to the calculation of the weighted-average Class V Common Stock shares outstanding.  The antidilutive effect of these awards was also not material. 
              (c) 
    Stock-based incentive awards have been excluded from the calculation of the DHI Group's diluted earnings (loss) per share because their effect would have been antidilutive, as the Company had a net loss from continuing operations attributable to the DHI Group for the periods presented.

  DHI Group Common Stock     and DHI Group    The Class A Common Stock, the Class B Common Stock, the Class C Common Stock, and the Class D Common Stock are collectively referred to as the DHI Group Common Stock.  The par value for all classes of DHI Group Common Stock is   $.01   per share.  The Class A Common Stock, the Class B Common Stock, the Class C Common Stock, and the Class D Common Stock share equally in dividends declared or accumulated and have equal participation rights in undistributed earnings.  The DHI Group generally refers to the direct and indirect interest of Dell Technologies in all of Dell Technologies' business, assets, properties, liabilities, and preferred stock other than those attributable to the Class V Group, as well as the DHI Group's retained interest in the Class V Group. 
    
  Class V Common Stock and Class V Group     In connection with the EMC merger transaction, the Company authorized   343 million   shares of Class V Common Stock.  The Class V Common Stock is a type of common stock commonly referred to as a tracking stock, which is a class of common stock that is intended to track the economic performance of a defined set of assets and liabilities.    As of     August 3, 2018  ,     the   199 million   shares of outstanding Class V Common Stock were intended to track the economic performance of approximately   61%   of Dell Technologies' economic interest in the Class V Group.  The Class V Group as of such date consisted solely of approximately   331 million   shares of VMware, Inc. common stock held by the Company.  The remaining   39%   economic interest in the Class V Group as of   August 3, 2018   was represented by the approximately   127 million   retained interest shares held by the DHI Group.

Repurchases of Common Stock; Treasury Stock 
    
  Class V Common Stock Repurchases by Dell Technologies Inc. 
    
  Since the date of the EMC merger transaction, the Company has authorized several programs to repurchase shares of its Class V Common Stock.  Of the   $2.1 billion   total authorized for repurchases under the programs,   $676 million   remained available as of   August 3, 2018  , all of which is attributable to the DHI Group Repurchase Program, which the board of directors suspended on December 13, 2016 until such time as it authorizes the reinstatement of that program.

During the   three months ended August 4, 2017  , the Company repurchased   0.4 million   shares of Class V Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of   $23 million  .      The repurchase of these shares was funded by proceeds received by the Class V Group from the sale by a subsidiary of the Company of shares of Class A common stock of VMware, Inc. owned by such subsidiary.  Share repurchases made by VMware, Inc. of its Class A common stock from a subsidiary of the Company do not affect the determination of the respective interests of the Class V Common Stock and the DHI Group in the Class V Group.  See Exhibit 99.1 filed with the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended   August 3, 2018   for more information regarding Unaudited Attributed Financial Information for the Class V Group. 
    
  All shares of Class V Common Stock repurchased by the Company pursuant to the repurchase programs are held as treasury stock at cost. 
    
  DHI Group Common Stock Repurchases 
    
  During the   three months ended August 3, 2018   the Company repurchased an immaterial number of shares of DHI Group Common Stock for approximately   $10 million  .  During the   three months ended August 4, 2017  , the Company did not repurchase any shares of DHI Group Common Stock. 
    
  All shares of DHI Group Common Stock repurchased by the Company are held as treasury stock at cost. 
    
  VMware, Inc. Class A Common Stock Repurchases by VMware, Inc.    
    
  Since the date of the EMC merger transaction, VMware, Inc.'s board of directors has authorized the repurchase of a total of   $2.2 billion   of VMware, Inc.'s Class A common stock, of which   $876 million   remained available as of   August 3, 2018  .

  Class V Transaction 
    
  On July 2, 2018, the Company announced that it had completed its evaluation of potential strategic business opportunities.  As a result of such evaluation, the Company has determined to pursue a transaction, referred to as the "Class V transaction," pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of July 1, 2018, between the Company and Teton Merger Sub Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  The Merger Agreement provides, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, that Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation. 
    
  The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, at the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each share of Class V Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive, at the holder s election, (i)   1.3665   shares (the "Share Consideration") of Class C Common Stock or (ii)   $109.00   in cash, without interest (the "Cash Consideration"), subject to an aggregate amount of Cash Consideration that may be received by holders of Class V Common Stock in the Merger not exceeding   $9 billion   (the "Aggregate Cash Consideration Cap").  If the total amount of Cash Consideration elected by holders of Class V Common Stock would exceed the Aggregate Cash Consideration Cap, a portion of the shares with respect to which a holder elects to receive the  

56

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (unaudited) 

Cash Consideration equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is the Aggregate Cash Consideration Cap and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration elected by holders, will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and the remaining portion of such shares held by such holders will be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration.  Any share of Class V Common Stock for which a valid election to receive Cash Consideration is not in effect at the Effective Time will be converted into Share Consideration.  Upon consummation of the Merger, all shares of the Class V Common Stock would be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and the Class C Common Stock would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
    
  In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as of the Effective Time and unless otherwise agreed by the Company and a holder of a Class V Common Stock-based equity award granted by the Company (a "Class V Award"), each Class V Award will be converted into a new equity award on the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting requirements and deferral provisions) with respect to the number of shares of Class C Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Class V Common Stock that were subject to the Class V Award multiplied by   1.3665   (rounded down to the nearest whole share).  The exercise price for any Class V Award options so converted will equal the exercise price of such Class V Award options immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by   1.3665   (rounded up to the nearest whole penny). 
    
  In connection with the Merger Agreement, the board of directors of VMware, Inc. declared a conditional   $11 billion   one time special cash dividend pro rata to holders of VMware, Inc. common stock.  Immediately prior to the completion of the Class V transaction, subject to the satisfaction of other conditions of the Class V transaction, as well as certain other conditions, VMware, Inc. will pay the special cash dividend to its stockholders.  Approximately   $8.95 billion   of the VMware, Inc. cash dividend will be received by the Company and used to fund all or substantially all of the Cash Consideration paid to holders of the Class V Common Stock in the Class V transaction.  The Company will fund any remaining cash consideration, which is not expected to be material, from cash on hand. 
    
  The obligation of the Company to complete the Merger and the Class V transaction is subject to stockholder approval and  
  certain other closing conditions as further described in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on July 2, 2018.

NOTE 17         REDEEMABLE SHARES    
    
  Awards under the Company's stock incentive plans include certain rights that allow the holder to exercise a put feature for the underlying Class A or Class C Common Stock after a   six   month holding period following the issuance of such common stock.  The put feature requires the Company to purchase the stock at its fair market value.  Accordingly, these awards and such common stock are subject to reclassification from equity to temporary equity, and the Company determines the award amounts to be classified as temporary equity as follows: 
             
    For stock options to purchase Class C Common Stock subject to service requirements, the intrinsic value of the option is multiplied by the portion of the option for which services have been rendered.  Upon exercise of the option, the amount in temporary equity represents the fair value of the Class C Common Stock. 
                
    For stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), or RSAs, any of which stock award types are subject to service requirements, the fair value of the share is multiplied by the portion of the share for which services have been rendered. 
                
    For share-based arrangements that are subject to the occurrence of a contingent event, those amounts are not reclassified to temporary equity until the contingency has been satisfied.  Contingent events include the achievement of performance-based metrics. 
     The amount of redeemable shares classified as temporary equity as of   August 3, 2018   was   $2.1 billion  , which consisted of   2.2 million   issued and outstanding unrestricted common shares,   1.3 million   RSUs,   0.4 million   RSAs, and   27.0 million   outstanding stock options.  The amount of redeemable shares classified as temporary equity as of   February 2, 2018   was   $384 million  , which consisted of   2.9 million   issued and outstanding unrestricted common shares,   0.4 million   RSUs,   0.1 million   RSAs, and   15.3 million   outstanding stock options.  The increase in the value of redeemable shares during the six months ended August 3, 2018 was primarily attributable to an increase in DHI Group Common Stock fair value, as well as the reassessment of vesting of performance-based awards.

NOTE 18       SEGMENT INFORMATION    
    
  The Company has   three   reportable segments that are based on the following business units:  Infrastructure Solutions Group ("ISG"); Client Solutions Group ("CSG"); and VMware. 
    
  ISG previously included Virtustream product and service offerings.  Virtustream's cloud software and infrastructure-as-a-service solutions enable customers to migrate, run, and manage mission-critical applications in cloud-based IT environments.  During the three months ended May 4, 2018, the Company made certain segment reporting changes, which included the movement of Virtustream's results from ISG to other businesses.  None of these changes impacted the Company's previously reported consolidated financial results, but the Company's prior period segment results have been recast to reflect this change. 
    
  ISG includes servers, networking, and storage, as well as services and third-party software and peripherals that are closely tied to the sale of ISG hardware.  CSG includes sales to commercial and consumer customers of desktops, thin client products, and notebooks, as well as services and third-party software and peripherals that are closely tied to the sale of CSG hardware.  VMware offerings include compute, management, cloud, networking, and security storage, mobility, and other end-user computing infrastructure software to businesses that provides a flexible digital foundation for the applications that empower businesses to serve their customers globally.  
    
  The reportable segments disclosed herein are based on information reviewed by the Company's management to evaluate the business segment results.  The Company's measure of segment operating income for management reporting purposes excludes the impact of other businesses, purchase accounting, amortization of intangible assets, unallocated corporate transactions, severance and facility action costs, and transaction-related expenses.  The Company does not allocate assets to the above reportable segments for internal reporting purposes.

("SecureWorks"), RSA Security LLC ("RSA Security"), Virtustream Group Holdings, Inc. ("Virtustream"), and Boomi, Inc. ("Boomi").  Together our strategically aligned family of businesses operates in close coordination across key functional areas such as product development, go-to-market and global services, and are supported by Dell Financial Services.  We believe this operational philosophy enables our platform to seamlessly deliver differentiated and holistic IT solutions to our customers, which has driven significant revenue growth and share gains. 
    
  As a result of our significant transformation since the going-private transaction in 2013, Dell Technologies today operates on an extraordinary scale with an unmatched breadth of complementary offerings.  Digital transformation has become essential to all businesses, and we have expanded our portfolio to include holistic solutions that enable our customers to drive their ongoing digital transformation initiatives.  Dell Technologies  integrated solutions help customers modernize their IT infrastructure, address workforce transformation and provide critical security solutions to protect against the ever increasing and evolving security threats.  With our extensive portfolio and our commitment to innovation, we have the ability to offer secure, integrated solutions that extend from the intelligent edge to the multi-cloud data center ecosystem, and we are at the forefront of the software-defined and cloud native infrastructure era.

Table of Contents  

Products and Services 
    
  We design, develop, manufacture, market, sell, and support a wide range of hardware, software, and services.  We are organized into the following business units, which are our reportable segments: Infrastructure Solutions Group; Client Solutions Group; and VMware. 

Infrastructure Solutions Group ("ISG")      Our Infrastructure Solutions Group, provides comprehensive data solutions and services, including storage, server, networking and services.  Our comprehensive portfolio of advanced storage solutions includes traditional storage solutions as well as next-generation storage solutions (such as all-flash arrays, scale-out file, object platforms, and software-defined solutions), while our server portfolio includes high-performance rack, blade, tower, and hyperscale servers.  Our networking portfolio helps our business customers transform and modernize their infrastructure, mobilize and enrich end-user experiences, and accelerate business applications and processes.  ISG also offers attached software, peripherals, and services, including support and deployment, configuration, and extended warranty services. 
       
  We are currently working to simplify our storage portfolio, with the goal of ensuring that we deliver the technology needed for our customers' digital transformation.  We anticipate that these changes will take two to three years to execute.  As our storage portfolio evolves, we will continue to support our current portfolio of storage solutions.   
    
  Approximately half of ISG revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region ("EMEA") and the Asia-Pacific and Japan region ("APJ"). 

Client Solutions Group ("CSG")     CSG includes branded hardware (such as PCs, workstations, and notebooks) and branded peripherals (such as displays and projectors), as well as third-party software and peripherals.  CSG also offers attached services, including support and deployment, configuration, and extended warranty services. 
       
  Approximately half of CSG revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in EMEA and APJ. 

VMware       The VMware reportable segment ("VMware") reflects the operations of VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW) within Dell Technologies.  See Exhibit 99.1 filed with this report for further details on the differences between VMware reportable segment results and VMware, Inc. results. 
       
  VMware provides compute, management, cloud, networking, and security storage, mobility, and other end-user computing infrastructure software to businesses that provides a flexible digital foundation for the applications that empower businesses to serve their customers globally.  VMware has continued to broaden its portfolio and solution offerings beyond software-defined compute software to enable customers to modernize data centers, integrate public clouds, transform networking and security, and empower digital workspaces. 
    
  Approximately half of VMware revenue is generated by sales to customers in the United States.  
    
  Our other businesses, described below, consist of product and service offerings of Pivotal, SecureWorks, RSA Security, Virtustream, and Boomi.  These businesses are not classified as reportable segments, either individually or collectively, as the results of the businesses are not material to our overall results and the businesses do not meet the criteria for reportable segments. 

Pivotal   (NYSE: PVTL) provides a leading cloud-native platform that makes software development and IT operations a strategic advantage for customers.  Pivotal's cloud-native platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, accelerates and streamlines software development by reducing the complexity of building, deploying and operating new cloud-native applications and modernizing legacy applications.  On April 24, 2018, Pivotal completed a registered underwritten initial public offering of its Class A common stock. 

SecureWorks   (NASDAQ: SCWX) is a leading global provider of intelligence-driven information security solutions singularly focused on protecting its clients from cyber attacks.  SecureWorks s solutions enable organizations of varying size and complexity to fortify their cyber defenses to prevent security breaches, detect malicious activity in near real time, prioritize and respond rapidly to security incidents and predict emerging threats.

Table of Contents  

RSA Security   provides essential cybersecurity solutions engineered to enable organizations to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks, confirm and manage identities, and, ultimately, help reduce IP theft, fraud, and cybercrime. 

Virtustream   offers cloud software and infrastructure-as-a-service solutions that enable customers to migrate, run, and manage mission-critical applications in cloud-based IT environments, which is a key element of our strategy to help customers support their applications in a variety of cloud-native environments.  Beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019, Virtustream results are reported within other businesses, rather than within ISG.  This change in reporting structure did not impact our previously reported consolidated financial results, but our prior period segment results have been recast to reflect the change. 

Boomi   specializes in cloud-based integration, connecting information between existing on-premise and cloud-based applications to ensure business processes are optimized, data is accurate and workflow is reliable. 
       
  See   Note 18   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   included in this report for more information about our other businesses. 
    
  For further discussion regarding our current reportable segments, see "Results of Operations   Business Unit Results."  
    
  Dell Financial Services 
    
  Dell Financial Services and its affiliates ("DFS") supports our businesses by offering and arranging various financing options and services for our customers in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.  DFS originates, collects, and services customer receivables primarily related to the purchase of our product, software, and service solutions.  DFS further strengthens our customer relationships through its flexible consumption models, which enable us to offer our customers the option to pay over time and, in certain cases, based on utilization, providing them with financial flexibility to meet their changing technological requirements.  The results of these operations are allocated to our segments based on the underlying product or service financed.  For additional information about our financing arrangements, see   Note 5   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   included in this report. 
    
  Strategic Investments and Acquisitions 
    
  As part of our strategy, we will continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic investments through our venture capital investment arm, Dell Technologies Capital, with a focus on emerging technology areas that are relevant to the Dell Technologies unique family of businesses and that will complement our existing portfolio of solutions.  Our investment areas include storage, software-defined networking, management and orchestration, security, machine learning and artificial intelligence, Big Data and analytics, cloud, Internet of Things, and software development operations.  In addition to these investments, we also may make disciplined acquisitions targeting businesses that advance our strategic objectives.  As of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , Dell Technologies held strategic investments of   $1.0 billion   and   $0.7 billion  , respectively.   
    
  Business Trends and Challenges 
    
  We are seeing an unprecedented rate of change in the IT industry.  Organizations of all kinds are embracing digital technology to achieve their business objectives.  Our vision is to be an essential infrastructure company and leader in end-user computing, data center infrastructure solutions, virtualization, Internet of Things ("IoT"), and cloud software that our customers continue to trust and rely on for their IT solutions and transformations as they embrace the multi-cloud environment of today.  To further advance this vision, we recently unveiled a new IoT strategy, division, and an array of solutions to support IoT adoption for our customers.  We accelerate results for our customers by enabling them to be more efficient, mobile, informed, and secure.  We continue to invest in research and development, sales, and other key areas of our business to deliver superior products and solutions capabilities and to drive execution of long-term sustainable growth.  We believe that our results will benefit from an integrated go-to-market strategy, including enhanced coordination among the family of Dell Technologies companies, and from our differentiated products and solutions capabilities.  We intend to continue to execute on our business model and seek to balance liquidity, profitability, and growth to position our company for long-term success.

We expect that ISG will continue to be impacted by the changing nature of the IT infrastructure market and competitive environment.  Cloud-native applications are expected to continue as a primary growth driver in the infrastructure market as IT organizations increasingly become multi-cloud environments.  We believe the complementary cloud solutions across our business strongly position us to meet these demands for our customers who are increasingly looking to leverage cloud-based computing.  We also continue to be impacted by the emerging trends of enterprises deploying software-defined storage, hyper-converged infrastructure, and modular solutions based on server-centric architectures.  These trends have put pressure on our traditional storage offerings, and we are focused on strategically repositioning our storage portfolio.  Offsetting this, however, is the unprecedented data growth throughout all industries, which is generating continued demand for our storage products and services.  We have leading solutions through our ISG and VMware data center offerings.  In addition, through our research and development efforts, we expect to develop new solutions in this rapidly changing industry that we believe will enable us to continue to provide superior solutions to our customers. 
    
  In ISG, we are also seeing increased interest in flexible consumption models by our customers as they seek to build greater flexibility into their cost structures.  These solutions are generally multi-year contracts that typically result in recognition of revenue over the term of the arrangement.  We expect these flexible consumption models will further strengthen our customer relationships, and will provide more predictable revenue streams over time.  
    
  We are able to leverage our traditional strength in the PC market to offer solutions and services that provide higher-value, recurring revenue streams.  Given current market trends, we expect that the demand environment will continue to be cyclical and that competitive dynamics will continue to pressure our CSG business.  However, we are committed to a long-term growth strategy that we believe will benefit from the consolidation trends that are occurring in our markets.  Our CSG offerings remain an important element of our strategy, generating strong cash flow and opportunities for cross-selling of complementary solutions.  CSG net revenue represented approximately half of our net revenue during both   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019   and   the second quarter of Fiscal 2018  .  
    
  We manage our business on a U.S. dollar basis.  However, we have a large global presence, generating approximately half of our revenue by sales to customers outside of the United States during the first six months of Fiscal 2019 and the first six months of Fiscal 2018.  Our revenues, therefore, can be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  We utilize a comprehensive hedging strategy intended to mitigate the impact of foreign currency volatility over time, and we adjust pricing when possible to further minimize foreign currency impacts. 
    
  Key Performance Metrics 
    
  Our key performance metrics are net revenue, operating income, adjusted EBITDA, and cash flows from operations, which are discussed elsewhere in this report. 
    
  Class V Transaction 
    
  On July 2, 2018, the Company announced that it had completed its evaluation of potential strategic business opportunities.  As a result of such evaluation, the Company has determined to pursue a transaction, referred to as the "Class V transaction,"  pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of July 1, 2018, between the Company and  Teton Merger Sub Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  The Merger Agreement provides, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, that Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation. 
    
  The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, at the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each share of Class V Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled and converted into the right to receive, at the holder s election, (i) 1.3665 shares (the "Share Consideration") of Class C Common Stock or (ii) $109.00 in cash, without interest (the "Cash Consideration"), subject to an aggregate amount of Cash Consideration that may be received by holders of Class V Common Stock in the Merger not exceeding $9 billion (the "Aggregate Cash Consideration Cap").  If the total amount of Cash Consideration elected by holders of Class V Common Stock would exceed the Aggregate Cash Consideration Cap, a portion of the shares with respect to which a holder elects to receive the Cash Consideration equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is the Aggregate Cash Consideration Cap and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration elected by holders, will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and the remaining portion of such shares held by such holders will be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration.  Any share of Class V Common Stock for which a valid election to receive Cash Consideration is not in effect at the Effective Time will be converted into Share Consideration.  Upon consummation of the Merger, all shares of the  

67 

Table of Contents  

Class V Common Stock would be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and the Class C Common Stock would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
    
  In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as of the Effective Time and unless otherwise agreed by the Company and a holder of a Class V Common Stock-based equity award granted by the Company (a "Class V Award"), each Class V Award will be converted into a new equity award on the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting requirements and deferral provisions) with respect to the number of shares of Class C Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Class V Common Stock that were subject to the Class V Award multiplied by 1.3665 (rounded down to the nearest whole share).  The exercise price for any Class V Award options so converted will equal the exercise price of such Class V Award options immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by 1.3665 (rounded up to the nearest whole penny). 
    
  In connection with the Merger Agreement, the board of directors of VMware, Inc. declared a conditional $11 billion one time special cash dividend pro rata to holders of VMware, Inc. common stock.  Immediately prior to the completion of the Class V transaction, subject to the satisfaction of other conditions of the Class V transaction, as well as certain other conditions, VMware, Inc. will pay the special cash dividend to its stockholders.  Approximately $8.95 billion of the VMware, Inc. cash dividend will be received by the Company and used to fund all or substantially all of the Cash Consideration paid to holders of the Class V Common Stock in the Class V transaction.  The Company will fund any remaining cash consideration, which is not expected to be material, from cash on hand. 
    
  The obligation of the Company to complete the Merger and the Class V transaction is subject to stockholder approval and certain other closing conditions as further described in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on July 2, 2018.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
    
  In this management's discussion and analysis, we use supplemental measures of our performance which are derived from our consolidated financial information but which are not presented in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").  These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP product net revenue; non-GAAP services net revenue; non-GAAP net revenue; non-GAAP product gross margin; non-GAAP services gross margin; non-GAAP gross margin; non-GAAP operating expenses; non-GAAP operating income; non-GAAP net income; earnings before interest and other, net, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA"); and adjusted EBITDA. 
    
  We use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis.  We believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance from period to period and better project our future consolidated financial performance as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures.  Moreover, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide our stakeholders with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and enabling them to make more meaningful period to period comparisons. 
    
  There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report.  Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. 
    
  Non-GAAP product net revenue, non-GAAP services net revenue, non-GAAP net revenue, non-GAAP product gross margin, non-GAAP services gross margin, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP net income, as defined by us, exclude the impact of amortization of intangible assets, purchase accounting, transaction-related expenses, other corporate expenses and, for non-GAAP net income from continuing operations, an aggregate adjustment for income taxes.  As the excluded items have a material impact on our financial results, our management compensates for this limitation by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures supplementally or for projections when comparable GAAP financial measures are not available.  The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for net revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, or net income prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. 
    
  Reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are presented below.  We encourage you to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures for each of the periods presented.  See the discussion below for more information on each of the excluded items as well as our reasons for excluding them from our non-GAAP results.  In future fiscal periods, we may exclude such items and may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items.  Accordingly, the exclusion of these items and other similar items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual. 
    
  The following is a summary of the items excluded from the most comparable GAAP financial measures to calculate our non-GAAP financial measures: 

Amortization of Intangible Assets           Amortization of intangible assets primarily consists of amortization of customer relationships, developed technology, and trade names.  In connection with the EMC merger transaction and the acquisition of Dell Inc. by Dell Technologies Inc. on October 29, 2013, referred to as the going-private transaction, all of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of EMC and Dell, respectively, were accounted for and recognized at fair value on the transaction dates.  Accordingly, for the periods presented, amortization of intangible assets represents amortization associated with intangible assets recognized in connection with the EMC merger transaction and the going-private transaction.  Amortization charges for purchased intangible assets are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions, and these charges may vary in amount from period to period.  We exclude these charges for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented below to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. 

69 

Table of Contents  

Impact of Purchase Accounting           The impact of purchase accounting includes purchase accounting adjustments, related to the EMC merger transaction and, to a lesser extent, the going-private transaction, recorded under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations.  This guidance prescribes that the purchase price be allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value of such assets and liabilities on the date of the transaction.  Accordingly, all of the assets and liabilities acquired in the EMC merger transaction and the going-private transaction were accounted for and recognized at fair value as of the respective transaction dates, and the fair value adjustments are being amortized over the estimated useful lives in the periods following the transactions.  The fair value adjustments primarily relate to deferred revenue, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment.  The purchase accounting adjustments and related amortization of those adjustments are reflected in our GAAP results; however, we evaluate the operating results of the underlying businesses on a non-GAAP basis, after removing such adjustments.  We believe that excluding the impact of purchase accounting provides results that are useful in understanding our current operating performance and provides more meaningful comparisons to our past operating performance. 

Transaction-related Expenses       Transaction-related expenses consist of acquisition, integration, and divestiture related costs, and are expensed as incurred.  These expenses primarily represent costs for legal, banking, consulting, and advisory services, as well as certain compensatory retention awards directly related to the EMC merger transaction.  During   the first six months of Fiscal 2019  , this category also included approximately $116 million of expenses incurred in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019 related to integration of our inventory policies and management process related to customer evaluation units. 

Other Corporate Expenses       Other corporate expenses consists of severance, facility action costs, and stock-based compensation expense associated with equity awards.  Severance costs are primarily related to severance and benefits for employees terminated pursuant to cost savings initiatives.  Facility action costs were $5 million and $14 million, respectively, during   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  , compared to $29 million and $109 million, respectively, during   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2018  .  We continue to integrate owned and leased facilities and may incur additional costs as we seek opportunities for operational efficiencies.  Other corporate expenses vary from period to period and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of these events.  Therefore, although we may incur these types of expenses in the future, we believe that eliminating these charges for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented below facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. 

Aggregate Adjustment for Income Taxes     The aggregate adjustment for income taxes is the estimated combined income tax effect for the adjustments described above.  During the first six months of Fiscal 2019, this category also includes approximately $154 million of tax benefits resulting from the impact of adopting the new revenue standard in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019.  The tax effects are determined based on the tax jurisdictions where the above items were incurred.

Table of Contents  

In addition to the above measures, we also use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to provide additional information for evaluation of our operating performance.  Adjusted EBITDA excludes purchase accounting adjustments related to the EMC merger transaction and the going-private transaction, acquisition, integration, and divestiture related costs, severance and facility action costs, and stock-based compensation expense.  We believe that, due to the non-operational nature of the purchase accounting entries, it is appropriate to exclude these adjustments. 
    
  As is the case with the non-GAAP measures presented above, users should consider the limitations of using EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, including the fact that those measures do not provide a complete measure of our operating performance.  EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not purport to be alternatives to net income (loss) as measures of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.  In particular, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management's discretionary use, as these measures do not consider certain cash requirements, such as working capital needs, capital expenditures, contractual commitments, interest payments, tax payments, and other debt service requirements.

  Overview 
    
  The strong global macro environment has generated strong demand for our products.  Dell Technologies is well-positioned to meet this demand with complementary solutions across our strategically aligned family of businesses.  During both   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  , our net revenue increased   18%  .  During   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  , our non-GAAP net revenue increased   16%   and   17%  , respectively.  The increases in net revenue and non-GAAP net revenue were attributable to increases in net revenue across all three business units.  The momentum in server, client, and VMware that started building last year has continued into Fiscal 2019 and we are seeing progress in the growth of our storage business revenue.   
    
  During the second quarter of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, our operating loss was   $13 million   and   $0.7 billion  , respectively.  The decrease in our operating loss for   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019   was primarily attributable to a decrease in amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments related to the EMC merger transaction and an increase in operating income for ISG.  During   the first six months of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018  , our operating loss was   $0.2 billion   and   $1.9 billion  , respectively.  The decrease in our operating loss for   the first six months of Fiscal 2019   was primarily attributable to a decrease in amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments and an increase in operating income for ISG and CSG.    
    
  Amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments that impacted operating income totaled   $1.7 billion   and   $2.1 billion   for the second quarter of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively, and   $3.5 billion   and   $4.3 billion   for   the first six months of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018  , respectively.  Excluding these costs, transaction-related expenses, and other corporate expenses, non-GAAP operating income during   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019   increased   13%   to   $2.1 billion  , and during   the first six months of Fiscal 2019   non-GAAP operating income increased   26%   to   $4.1 billion  .  Non-GAAP operating income during   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019   increased primarily due to an increase in operating income for ISG.  The   increase   in non-GAAP operating income for   the first six months of Fiscal 2019   was primarily due to an increase in operating income for ISG and CSG. 
    
  Cash provided by operating activities was   $3.8 billion   and   $2.1 billion   during   the first six months of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018  , respectively.  The increase in operating cash flows during   the first six months of Fiscal 2019   was driven by business momentum, improved profitability, and working capital discipline.  See "Market Conditions, Liquidity, and Capital Commitments" for further information on our cash flow metrics. 
    
  Net Revenue 
    
  During both   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  , our net revenue increased   18%  .  During   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  , our non-GAAP net revenue increased   16%   and   17%  , respectively.  The increases in net revenue and non-GAAP net revenue were attributable to increases in net revenue across all three business units.  See "Business Unit Results" for further information. 

Product Net Revenue     Product net revenue includes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software licenses.  During   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019  , product net revenue and non-GAAP product net revenue both increased   20%  , and during   the first six months of Fiscal 2019  , product net revenue and non-GAAP product net revenue both increased   21%  .  These increases were attributable to an increase in product revenue for ISG, CSG, and VMware, driven by strength in sales across all product categories.   

Services Net Revenue       Services net revenue includes revenue from our services offerings and support services related to hardware products and software licenses.  During   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019  , services net revenue and non-GAAP services net revenue increased   8%   and   5%  , respectively.  During   the first six months of Fiscal 2019  , services net revenue  

75 

Table of Contents  

and non-GAAP services net revenue increased   8%   and   5%  , respectively.  These increases were primarily due to an increase in services revenue for support and deployment and VMware software maintenance.  
    
  From a geographical perspective, net revenue generated by sales to customers in all regions increased in   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019   due to strong performance globally in all three business units. 
    
  Gross Margin 
    
  During   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  , our gross margin increased   23%   to   $6.1 billion   and   27%   to   $12.0 billion  , respectively.  Our gross margin percentage increased   130   basis points to   26.7%   and   200   basis points to   27.1%  , respectively, during   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  .  The increases in our gross margin were primarily attributable to higher gross margin across all three business units and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in the combined impact of amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting adjustments.  The increases in our gross margin percentage during   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019   were primarily attributable to a decrease in amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting adjustments, offset partially by gross margin rate pressure in CSG and product mix dynamics in ISG due to growth in sales of servers.  
    
  Our gross margin for   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019   included the effect of amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting adjustments of   $0.9 billion   and   $1.8 billion  , respectively.  In comparison, the impact of amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting adjustments in   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2018   totaled   $1.3 billion   and   $2.6 billion  , respectively.  Excluding these costs, transaction-related expenses, and other corporate expenses, total non-GAAP gross margin for   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019   increased   13%   to   $7.1 billion   and   16%   to   $14.0 billion  , respectively, and non-GAAP gross margin percentage decreased   90   basis points to   30.6%   and   30   basis points to   31.3%  , respectively.  The increases in our non-GAAP gross margin were attributable to increases in gross margin across all three business units.  The decreases in our non-GAAP gross margin percentage were primarily due to gross margin rate pressure in CSG and product mix dynamics in ISG due to growth in sales of servers.  

Products     During   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019  , product gross margin increased   38%   to   $3.2 billion  , and product gross margin percentage increased   230   basis points to   17.7%  .  During   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019  , non-GAAP product gross margin increased   20%   to   $4.0 billion  , and non-GAAP product gross margin percentage remained constant at   21.9%  .  These increases in product gross margin and non-GAAP product gross margin were driven primarily by increases in product revenue in all three business units due to strength in sales of ISG servers and storage, CSG commercial products, and VMware software licenses.  Product gross margin also benefited from a decrease in the impact of amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting adjustments.  Product gross margin percentage increased primarily as a result of a decrease in the impact of amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting adjustments.  Non-GAAP product gross margin percentage remained unchanged, due to increases in product gross margin percentages for ISG and VMware that were offset by a decrease in product gross margin percentage for CSG.  
       
  During   the first six months of Fiscal 2019   product gross margin increased   52%   to   $6.3 billion  , and product gross margin percentage increased   360   basis points to   18.0%  .  During   the first six months of Fiscal 2019  , non-GAAP product gross margin increased   28%   to   $7.9 billion  , and non-GAAP product gross margin percentage increased   130   basis points to   22.6%  .  These increases in product gross margin and non-GAAP product gross margin were driven primarily by increases in product revenue in all three business units due to strength in sales of ISG servers and storage, CSG commercial products, and VMware software licenses.  Product gross margin percentage and non-GAAP product gross margin percentage increased primarily as a result of higher product gross margin percentages for ISG and CSG commercial products. 
    
  In the second quarter of Fiscal 2018, we entered into a settlement agreement with a vendor to resolve a dispute regarding past pricing practices.  Our gross margin for the second quarter of Fiscal 2018 included a benefit of $68 million related to receipt of payment under the settlement.  Vendor settlements are allocated to our segments based on the relative amount of affected vendor products sold by each segment.  The $68 million settlement benefit was entirely allocated to CSG. 

Services     During   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019  , services gross margin increased   10%   to   $2.9 billion  , and services gross margin percentage increased   110   basis points to   60.9%  .  Services gross margin and gross margin percentage increased due to growth in services gross margin across all business units, particularly in VMware services and ISG support and deployment.  Services gross margin also benefited from a decrease in purchase accounting adjustments, which totaled   $0.2 billion   and   $0.3 billion  , respectively, during   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018  .  Excluding

Table of Contents  

these costs, transaction-related expenses, and other corporate expenses, non-GAAP services gross margin increased   5%   to   $3.1 billion  , and non-GAAP services gross margin percentage remained unchanged at   62.5%  .  
    
  During   the first six months of Fiscal 2019  , services gross margin increased   8%   to   $5.7 billion  , and services gross margin percentage increased   30   basis points to   60.5%  .  Services gross margin and gross margin percentage increased due to growth in services gross margin across all business units, particularly in VMware services and ISG support and deployment.  Services gross margin also benefited from a decrease in purchase accounting adjustments, which totaled   $0.3 billion   and   $0.6 billion  , respectively, during   the first six months of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018  .  Excluding these costs, transaction-related expenses, and other corporate expenses, non-GAAP services gross margin increased   3%   to   $6.1 billion  , and non-GAAP services gross margin percentage decreased   90   basis points to   62.2%  . 
    
  Vendor Programs and Settlements 
    
  Our gross margin is affected by our ability to achieve competitive pricing with our vendors and contract manufacturers, including through our negotiation of a variety of vendor rebate programs to achieve lower net costs for the various components we include in our products.  Under these programs, vendors provide us with rebates or other discounts from the list prices for the components, which are generally elements of their pricing strategy.  We account for vendor rebates and other discounts as a reduction in cost of net revenue.  We manage our costs on a total net cost basis, which includes supplier list prices reduced by vendor rebates and other discounts. 
    
  The terms and conditions of our vendor rebate programs are largely based on product volumes and are generally negotiated either at the beginning of the annual or quarterly period, depending on the program.  The timing and amount of vendor rebates and other discounts we receive under the programs may vary from period to period, reflecting changes in the competitive environment.  We monitor our component costs and seek to address the effects of any changes to terms that might arise under our vendor rebate programs.  Our gross margins for   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018   were not materially affected by any changes to the terms of our vendor rebate programs, as the amounts we received under these programs were generally stable relative to our total net cost.  We are not aware of any significant changes to vendor pricing or rebate programs that may impact our results in the near term. 
    
  In addition, we have pursued legal action against certain vendors and are currently involved in negotiations with other vendors regarding their past pricing practices.  We have negotiated settlements with some of these vendors and may have additional settlements in future periods.  These settlements are allocated to our segments based on the relative amount of affected vendor products sold by each segment.  As discussed above, a pricing settlement was recorded in the second quarter of Fiscal 2018 that benefited product gross margins by $68 million in the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2018.  No such settlements were recorded in   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019   that would have a material impact on product gross margins in the current quarter or affect comparability with product gross margin in the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2018.

Operating Expenses 
    
  The following table presents information regarding our operating expenses during each of the periods presented: 

During   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  , total operating expenses increased   9%   and   7%  , respectively.  Our operating expenses include the impact of purchase accounting, amortization of intangible assets, transaction-related expenses, and other corporate expenses.  In aggregate, these items totaled   $1.2 billion   for both the second quarter of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, and   $2.3 billion   and   $2.6 billion   for   the first six months of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018  , respectively.  Excluding these costs, total non-GAAP operating expenses for   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019   increased   13%   and   12%  , respectively.  The increases in operating expenses and non-GAAP operating expenses were primarily due to an increase in selling expenses associated with our revenue growth and sales headcount. 

Selling, General, and Administrative     Selling, general, and administrative ("SG A") expenses increased   9%   and   8%  , respectively, during   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  .  The increases in SG A expenses were primarily driven by investments in our go-to-market capabilities and higher performance-driven commission costs.  

Research and Development       Research and development ("R D") expenses are primarily composed of personnel-related expenses related to product development.  R D expenses as a percentage of net revenue for the second quarter of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 were approximately   5.1%   and   5.6%  , respectively.  In comparison, R D expenses as a percentage of net revenue for the first six months of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 were approximately   5.1%   and   5.9%  , respectively.  The decreases in R D expenses as a percentage of net revenue was attributable to revenue growth that outpaced the scale of R D investments.  As our industry continues to change and as the needs of our customers evolve, we intend to support R D initiatives to innovate and introduce new and enhanced solutions into the market. 
        
  We continue to make investments designed to enable growth, particularly in our sales force, marketing, and R D, while balancing our efforts to drive cost efficiencies in the business. 
     
  Operating Income/Loss 
    
  During the second quarter of Fiscal 2019, our operating loss decreased   98%   to   $13 million  .  The decrease in our operating loss for   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019   was primarily attributable to a decrease in amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments and an increase in operating income for ISG.  During the first six months of Fiscal 2019, our operating loss decreased to   91%   to   $0.2 billion  .  The decrease in our operating loss for   the first six months of Fiscal 2019   was primarily attributable to a decrease in amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments and an increase in operating income for ISG and CSG.  
    
  Amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments that impacted operating income totaled   $1.7 billion   and   $2.1 billion   for second quarter of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively, and   $3.5 billion   and   $4.3 billion   for   the first six months of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018  , respectively.  Excluding these costs, transaction-related expenses, and other corporate

expenses, non-GAAP operating income during   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019   increased   13%   to   $2.1 billion  , and non-GAAP operating income increased   26%   to   $4.1 billion   during   the first six months of Fiscal 2019  .  Non-GAAP operating income during   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019   increased primarily due to an increase in operating income for ISG.  The   increase   in non-GAAP operating income for   the first six months of Fiscal 2019   was primarily due to an increase in operating income for ISG and CSG. 
    
  Interest and Other, Net 
    
  The following table provides     information regarding     interest and other, net for each of the periods presented:      

Effective in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019, we adopted the new accounting guidance for "Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities."  As a result, we record in interest and other, net, changes in the fair value of our publicly-traded strategic investments and changes in the value of our strategic investments without readily determinable fair values when adjusted to fair value upon observable price changes or impairment.  During   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  , changes in interest and other, net were favorable by   $90 million   and   $192 million  , respectively, primarily due gains on strategic investments.  See   Note 1   and   Note 4   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   included in this report for further information regarding our recently adopted accounting standards and our investments, respectively. 
    
  Income and Other Taxes 
    
  For   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  , our effective income tax rates were   1.5%   and   8.4%  , respectively, on pre-tax losses of   $0.5 billion   and   $1.1 billion  , respectively.  For   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2018  , our effective income tax rates were   38.9%   and   36.4%  , respectively, on pre-tax losses of   $1.2 billion   and   $3.1 billion  , respectively.  The changes in our effective income tax rates for   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019   were primarily attributable to impacts of U.S. Tax Reform.  The change in our effective income tax rate for   the first six months of Fiscal 2019  , was also impacted by discrete tax benefits resulting from the impact of adopting the new revenue standard. 
    
  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("U.S. Tax Reform" or the "Act") was signed into law on December 22, 2017.  U.S. Tax Reform lowers the U.S. corporate income tax rate to   21%   from   35%  , establishes a modified territorial system requiring a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the "Transition Tax"), requires a minimum tax on certain future earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries while providing for future tax-free repatriation of earnings through a 100% dividends-received deduction, and places limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense.  
    
  GAAP requires the effect of a change in tax laws to be recognized in the period that includes the enactment date.  Accordingly, for Fiscal 2018 we recognized a provisional tax benefit of   $0.5 billion   related to U.S. Tax Reform, primarily driven by a   $1.5 billion   tax benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, offset by   $1.0 billion   of current and future income tax expenses related to the Transition Tax.  Our provisional benefit will be adjusted once the analysis is complete, but no later than the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019.  We continue to collect and process the data necessary to complete the analysis.  In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department issued proposed regulations as guidance for the Transition Tax on August 1, 2018.  We are also evaluating the impact of this guidance on the calculation of our provisional benefit.  As a result, no adjustments have been made to the provisional amount recorded for Fiscal 2018.  Revisions to our provisional estimates may be material.  Any final guidance to be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department also could further affect the provisional calculation.   

79 

Table of Contents  

Additionally, when we file our U.S. tax return for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2018, any changes to the tax positions for temporary differences compared to the estimates used for the provisional estimate will result in an adjustment of the estimated tax benefit recorded for Fiscal 2018. 
    
  Our effective income tax rate can fluctuate depending on the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings, as our foreign earnings are generally taxed at lower rates than in the United States.  The differences between our effective income tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate of   21%   principally result from the geographical distribution of income and differences between the book and tax treatment of certain items.  In certain jurisdictions, our tax rate is significantly less than the applicable statutory rate as a result of tax holidays.  The majority of our foreign income that is subject to these tax holidays and lower tax rates is attributable to Singapore, China, and Malaysia.  A significant portion of these income tax benefits is related to a tax holiday that will expire at the end of Fiscal 2019.  We are currently seeking new terms for the affected subsidiary beyond Fiscal 2019, and it is uncertain whether any terms will be agreed upon.  Our other tax holidays will expire in whole or in part during Fiscal 2019 through Fiscal 2023.  Many of these tax holidays and reduced tax rates may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. 
    
  For further discussion regarding tax matters, including the status of income tax audits, see   Note 12   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   included in this report.  
    
  Net Income/Loss 
    
  During   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  , net loss decreased   38%   to   $0.5 billion   and   49%   to   $1.0 billion  , respectively.  The decreases in net loss during   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019   were primarily attributable to a decrease in operating loss and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in interest and other, net expense, which was partially offset by a decrease in tax benefit.   
    
  Net loss for   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019   included amortization of intangible assets, the impact of purchase accounting, transaction-related expenses, and other corporate expenses.  Excluding these costs and the related tax impacts, non-GAAP net income increased   21%   to   $1.3 billion   and   35%   to   $2.5 billion   during   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  , respectively.  The increases in non-GAAP net income were primarily attributable to an increase in operating income and a decrease in interest and other, net expense, which was partially offset by an increase in income tax expense.  
    
  Non-controlling Interests 
    
  During   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  , net income attributable to non-controlling interests was   $38 million   and   $136 million  , respectively, compared to a net loss attributable to non-controlling interests of   $7 million   and   $39 million  , respectively, during   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2018  .  Net income or loss attributable to non-controlling interests consisted of net income or loss attributable to our non-controlling interests in VMware, Inc., Pivotal, and SecureWorks.  For more information about our non-controlling interests, see   Note 14   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   included in this report. 
    
  Net Loss Attributable to Dell Technologies Inc. 
    
  Net loss attributable to Dell Technologies Inc. represents net loss and an adjustment for non-controlling interests.  During   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018  , net loss attributable to Dell Technologies Inc. was   $0.5 billion   and   $0.7 billion  , respectively, compared to   $1.1 billion   and   $1.9 billion  , respectively, during   the first six months of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018  .  The decreases in net loss attributable to Dell Technologies Inc. were primarily attributable to decreases in net loss over both periods.

Business Unit Results 
    
  Our reportable segments are based on the following business units: ISG, CSG, and VMware.  A description of our three business units is provided under "Introduction."  See   Note 18   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   included in this report for a reconciliation of net revenue and operating income by reportable segment to consolidated net revenue and consolidated operating loss, respectively. 
    
  During the first quarter of Fiscal 2019, we made certain segment reporting changes, which included the movement of Virtustream results from ISG to other businesses.  None of these changes impacted our previously reported consolidated financial results, but our prior period segment results have been recast to reflect this change. 
    
  Infrastructure Solutions Group: 
    
  The following table presents net revenue and operating income attributable to ISG for the respective periods: 

Net Revenue         During both   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  , ISG net revenue increased   24%  , primarily due to an increase in sales of servers and networking as well as an increase in sales of storage.  Revenue from servers and networking increased   34%   and   37%  , respectively, during   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  , driven by an increase in both average selling price and units sold of our PowerEdge servers.  Average selling prices increased due to the sale of servers with higher memory and storage content, which is driven by customer demand for servers that enable big data analytics and software-defined solutions, as well as increased component costs.  Storage revenue increased   13%   and   12%  , respectively, during   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019   due to accumulated demand from the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 that was realized in the first half of the year, as well as strong growth in our unstructured storage array solutions and our hyper-converged infrastructure products.  We were encouraged by the improved demand for our storage products, where we have been making go-to-market investments and enhancements to our solutions offerings.  Component costs during the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019 were slightly inflationary in the aggregate for ISG, and we continue to monitor our pricing in response to the current component cost environment.  However, we expect the aggregate ISG component cost environment to become slightly deflationary through the second half of Fiscal 2019. 
    
  In ISG, we continue to see interest in flexible consumption models by our customers as they seek to build greater flexibility into their cost structures.  We generally provide these solutions under multi-year contracts that typically result in recognition of revenue over the term of the arrangement.  We expect these flexible consumption models will further strengthen our customer relationships and will build more predictable revenue streams over time.  
    
  From a geographical perspective, net revenue attributable to ISG increased across all regions during   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  . 
    
  Operating Income         During   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  , ISG operating income increased   230   basis points to   11.0%   and   290   basis points to   10.9%  , respectively, primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.  Despite the investments we have been making in our go-to-market capabilities and solutions offerings, operating

expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue as a result of revenue growth that outpaced the scale of these investments.  The benefit from the decrease in operating expense percentage was partially offset by a decrease in ISG gross margin percentage due to a shift in product mix to servers, which typically have a lower gross margin than storage products. 
    
  Client Solutions Group: 
    
  The following table presents net revenue and operating income attributable to CSG for the respective periods: 

Net Revenue         During both   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  , CSG net revenue increased   13%  , driven by continued strong demand and increased sales volume across both commercial and consumer categories in notebooks, workstations, and desktops, as we were able to deliver strong performance in a better than expected demand environment.  Overall average selling prices were higher, driven by an increase in both the commercial and consumer product categories, as we managed our pricing in response to the inflationary cost environment over the past year.  We expect the cost environment for CSG to be deflationary for the remainder of Fiscal 2019.  
    
  From a geographical perspective, net revenue attributable to CSG increased across all regions during   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  . 
    
  Operating Income         During the second quarter of Fiscal 2019, CSG operating income as a percentage of net revenue decreased   160   basis points to   3.8%  .  The changes in our CSG operating income percentage included a $68 million favorable impact from a vendor pricing settlement received during the second quarter of Fiscal 2018, which resulted in an incremental benefit of 70 basis points to our operating income percentage during the period.  Excluding the benefit of the vendor settlement to operating income in the second quarter of Fiscal 2018, we experienced a decrease of 90 basis points in our operating income percentage.  This decrease was primarily due to higher component costs that negatively impacted CSG gross margin and to an increase in CSG operating expense as a percentage of revenue resulting from higher performance-driven commission costs and marketing expense related to our net revenue growth.  
    
  During the first six months of Fiscal 2019, CSG operating income as a percentage of net revenue and was unchanged at   4.5%  .  The vendor pricing settlement received during the second quarter of Fiscal 2018 resulted in an incremental benefit of 40 basis points to our operating income percentage during the first six months of Fiscal 2018.  Excluding the benefit of the vendor settlement to operating income in the second quarter of Fiscal 2018, we experienced a decrease of 40 basis points in CSG operating income.  The decrease was attributable to higher component costs that negatively impacted CSG gross margin and to an increase in CSG operating expense as a percentage of revenue due to higher performance-driven commission costs and marketing expense related to our net revenue growth.

VMware: 
    
  The following table presents net revenue and operating income attributable to VMWare for the respective periods: 

Net Revenue         VMware net revenue primarily consisted of revenue from the sale of software licenses under perpetual licenses, related software maintenance and support, training, consulting services, and hosted services.  VMware net revenue during both   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019   increased   11%  , primarily due to growth in software license revenue and sales of maintenance services.  Software license revenue benefited from broad-based growth across the product portfolio.  Software maintenance revenue benefited from strong renewals, revenue recognized from maintenance contracts sold in prior periods, and new maintenance contracts sold during the period. 
    
  From a geographical perspective, approximately half of VMware net revenue during   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019   was generated by sales to customers in the United States.  VMware net revenue for   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019   benefited from growth in all major geographies.  
    
  Operating Income         During   the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019  , VMware operating income as a percentage of net revenue decreased   320   basis points to   33.5%   and   320   basis points to   32.0%  , respectively, driven by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue due to an increase in compensation-related expense associated with sales and sales support, resulting from increased performance-driven commission costs and headcount, as well as an increase in R D expenses.

OTHER BALANCE SHEET ITEMS 
    
  Accounts Receivable  
    
  We sell products and services directly to customers and through a variety of sales channels, including retail distribution.  Our accounts receivable, net, was   $11.2 billion   and   $11.7 billion   as of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , respectively.  We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover receivables that may be deemed uncollectible.  The allowance for losses is based on a provision for accounts that are collectively evaluated based on historical bad debt experience as well as specific identifiable customer accounts that are deemed at risk.  As of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , the allowance for doubtful accounts was   $102 million   and   $103 million  , respectively.  Based on our assessment, we believe that we are adequately reserved for expected credit losses.  We monitor the aging of our accounts receivable and continue to take actions to reduce our exposure to credit losses. 
    
  Dell Financial Services and Financing Receivables 
    
  Dell Financial Services and its affiliates ("DFS") offers a wide range of financial services, including originating, collecting, and servicing customer receivables primarily related to the purchase of Dell Technologies' products and services.  In some cases, we also offer financing on the purchase of third-party technology products that complement our portfolio of products and services.  New financing originations were   $1.9 billion   and   $1.6 billion   for   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018  , respectively, and   $3.6 billion   and   $2.7 billion   for   the first six months of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018  , respectively.  As of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , our financing receivables, net were   $8.2 billion   and   $7.6 billion  , respect  ively.    
    
  We have securitization facilities to fund revolving loans and fixed-term leases and loans through consolidated special purpose entities, referred to as SPEs, which we account for as secured borrowings.  We transfer certain U.S. and European customer financing receivables to these SPEs, whose purpose is to facilitate the funding of customer receivables through financing arrangements with multi-seller conduits that issue asset-backed debt securities in the capital markets and to private investors.  During   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018  , we transferred   $1.2 billion   and   $1.0 billion  , respectively, to these SPEs, and during   the first six months of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018  , we transferred   $2.5 billion   and   $1.9 billion  , respectively, to the SPEs.  The DFS debt related to all of our securitization facilities included as secured borrowings was   $4.6 billion   and   $3.9 billion   as of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , respectively.  In addition, the carrying amount of the corresponding financing receivables was   $5.2 billion   and   $4.6 billion   as of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , respectively.  
  We maintain an allowance to cover expected financing receivable credit losses and evaluate credit loss expectations based on our total portfolio.  For   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018  , the principal charge-off rate for our total portfolio was   1.4%   and   1.8%  ,     respectively.  For   the first six months of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018  , the principal charge-off rate for our total portfolio was   1.3%   and   1.7%  ,     respectively.  The credit quality of our financing receivables has improved in recent years due to an overall improvement in the credit environment and as the mix of high-quality commercial accounts in our portfolio has continued to increase.  The allowance for losses is determined based on various factors, including historical and anticipated experience, past due receivables, receivable type, and customer risk profile.  As of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , the allowance for financing receivable losses was   $126 million   and   $145 million  , respectively.  In general, the loss rates on our financing receivables have improved over the periods presented.  We expect relatively stable loss rates in future periods, with movements in these rates being primarily driven by seasonality and a continued shift in portfolio composition to lower risk commercial assets.  We continue to monitor broader economic indicators and their potential impact on future loss performance.  We have an extensive process to manage our exposure to customer credit risk, including active management of credit lines and our collection activities.  We also sell selected fixed-term financing receivables to unrelated third parties on a periodic basis, primarily to manage certain concentrations of customer credit exposure.  Based on our assessment of the customer financing receivables, we believe that we are adequately reserved. 
  See   Note 5   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   included in this report for additional information about our financing receivables and the associated allowances. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   August 3, 2018  , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Table of Contents  

MARKET CONDITIONS, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL COMMITMENTS 
    
  Market Conditions 
    
  We regularly monitor economic conditions and associated impacts on the financial markets and our business.  We consistently evaluate the financial health of our supplier base, carefully manage customer credit, diversify counterparty risk, and monitor the concentration risk of our cash and cash equivalents balances globally.  We routinely monitor our financial exposure to borrowers and counterparties. 
    
  We monitor credit risk associated with our financial counterparties using various market credit risk indicators such as credit ratings issued by nationally recognized rating agencies and changes in market credit default swap levels.  We perform periodic evaluations of our positions with these counterparties and may limit exposure to any one counterparty in accordance with our policies.  We monitor and manage these activities depending on current and expected market developments.  
    
  We use derivative instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures.  We use forward contracts and purchased options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  In addition, we primarily use forward contracts and may use purchased options to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency.  See   Note 7   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   included in this report for more information about our use of derivative instruments. 
    
  We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our variable-rate debt and investment portfolio.  In the normal course of business, we follow established policies and procedures to manage this risk, including monitoring of our asset and liability mix.  As a result, we do not anticipate any material losses from interest rate risk. 
    
  The impact of any credit adjustments related to our use of counterparties on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report has been immaterial. 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  To support our ongoing business operations, we rely on operating cash flows as our primary source of liquidity.  We monitor the efficiency of our balance sheet to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to support our strategic initiatives.  In addition to internally generated cash, we have access to othe  r capital sources to finance our strategic initiatives and fund growth in our financing operations.  As of     August 3, 2018  , we had     $15.3 billion     of tota  l cash and cash equivalents, just over half of which was held outside of the United States.  Our strategy is to deploy capital from any potential source, whether internally generated cash or debt, depending on the adequacy and availability of that source of capital and whether it can be accessed in a cost-effective manner. 
    
  A significant portion of our income is earned in non-U.S. jurisdictions.  Prior to the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform as discussed above in "Results of Operations   Income and Other Taxes", earnings available to be repatriated to the United States would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, less applicable foreign tax credits.  U.S. Tax Reform fundamentally changes the U.S. approach to taxation of foreign earnings to a modified territorial tax system, which generally allows companies to make distributions of non-U.S. earnings to the United States without incurring additional U.S. federal tax.  However, local and U.S. state taxes may still apply.  We have provided for future tax liabilities on income earned in non-U.S. jurisdictions, except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. 
    
  During the second half of Fiscal 2019, as discussed above in "Introduction   Class V Transaction," we expect to complete a transaction in which the issued and outstanding shares of Class V Common Stock will be exchanged for shares of Class C Common Stock or cash at the stockholder s election.  The Merger Agreement provides that no more than $9 billion of cash, in the aggregate, will be paid to holders of Class V Common Stock in connection with the Class V transaction.   
    
  To fund the cash payment to stockholders, VMware, Inc. declared a conditional $11 billion one-time special cash dividend (the "Special Dividend"), payable pro-rata to VMware, Inc. stockholders as of the dividend record date and in connection with the closing of the proposed Class V transaction.  The payment of the dividend is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to the Class V transaction and other specified conditions.  We will fund all, or substantially all, of the cash consideration to be paid in the Class V transaction from our portion of the proceeds of the Special Dividend.  Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments

will decline significantly, commensurate with the cash required to fund this transaction.  VMware, Inc. has advised us that, following its payment of the Special Dividend, VMware, Inc. expects to return to its historical capital allocation policy. 
    
  The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents as well as our available borrowings as of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  :

  (a)  Of the   $15.3 billion   of cash and cash equivalents as of   August 3, 2018  ,   $8.1 billion   was held by VMware, Inc.  Of the   $13.9 billion   of cash and cash equivalents as of February 2, 2018,   $6.0 billion   was held by VMware, Inc.  Amounts exclude restricted cash. 
    
  Our revolving credit facilities include the Revolving Credit Facility and China Revolving Credit Facility.  Available borrowings u  nder these facilities are reduced by draws on the facility and, under the Revolving Credit Facility, outstanding letters of credit.      As of   August 3, 2018  , there were no borrowings outstanding under either facility and remaining available borrowings totaled approximately   $3.8 billion  .  These available borrowings may be used periodically for general corporate purposes. 
    
  The VMware Revolving Credit Facility and the Pivotal Revolving Credit Facility have maximum aggregate borrowings of   $1.0 billion   and   $100 million  , respectively.  None of the net proceeds of such borrowings will be made available to support the operations or satisfy any corporate purposes of Dell Technologies, other than the operations and corporate purposes of VMware, Inc., Pivotal, and their respective subsidiaries.  As of   August 3, 2018  ,   $1.0 billion   was available under the VMware Revolving Credit Facility and   $100 million   was available under the Pivotal Revolving Credit Facility. 
    
  See   Note 6   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   included in this report for additional information about each of the foregoing revolving credit facilities. 
    
  We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, along with cash that will be provided by future operations and borrowings expected to be available under the Revolving Credit Facility and China Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient over at least the next twelve months to fund our operations, capital expenditures, share repurchases, debt service requirements, and other corporate needs.

Debt 
    
  The following table summarizes our outstanding debt as of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  : 

The outstanding principal amount of our debt was   $50.3 billion   as of   August 3, 2018  , which included core debt of   $37.1 billion  .  We define core debt as the total principal amount of our debt, less DFS related debt, other debt, and unrestricted subsidiary debt. 
    
  DFS related debt primarily represents debt from securitization and structured financing programs.  To fund expansion of the DFS business, we balance the use of our securitization and structured financing programs with other sources of liquidity.  We approximate the amount of our debt used to fund the DFS business by applying a 7:1 debt to equity ratio to our financing receivables balance, based on the underlying credit quality of the assets.  See   Note 5   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   included in this report for more information about our DFS debt. 
    
  As of   August 3, 2018   and   February 2, 2018  , other debt primarily consisted of the   $2.0 billion   Margin Loan Facility. 
    
  VMware, Inc., Pivotal, and their respective subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries for purposes of the existing debt of Dell Technologies.  Neither Dell Technologies nor any of its subsidiaries, other than VMware, Inc., is obligated to make payment on the VMware Notes.  None of the net proceeds of the VMware Notes will be made available to support the operations or satisfy any corporate purposes of Dell Technologies, other than the operations and corporate purposes of VMware, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
    
  Our requirements for cash to pay principal and interest on our debt increased significantly due to the borrowings we incurred to finance the EMC merger transaction.  We have made good progress in paying down core debt since the EMC merger transaction.  We believe we will continue to be able to make our debt principal and interest payments, including the short-term maturities, from existing and expected sources of cash and we will continue to focus on paying down core debt.  Despite the debt repayments, interest expense was   $1.2 billion   during both the   six months ended August 3, 2018 and August 4, 2017   due to an increase in LIBOR, and also due to an increase in the debt used to fund the DFS business, as we see continued demand for customer financing.  We expect that continued demand for customer financing as well as an increase in LIBOR will impact

future interest expense on our variable-rate debt.  We or our affiliates, at our or their sole discretion, may purchase, redeem, prepay, refinance, or otherwise retire any amount of our outstanding indebtedness under the terms of such indebtedness at any time and from time to time, in open market or negotiated transactions with the holders of such indebtedness, as appropriate market conditions exist. 
    
  During   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019  , we repaid approximately  $2.5 billion   principal amount of our   1.875%   unsecured notes due April 2018 and   $68 million     principal amount     of our term loan facilities.  Further, we issued an additional   $868 million  , net, in DFS debt to support the expansion of our financing receivables portfolio.  
    
  See   Note 6   of the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   included in this report for more information about our debt and our unrestricted subsidiaries. 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  The following table contains a summary of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the respective periods: 

Operating Activities     Cash provided by operating activities was   $3.8 billion   for   the first six months of Fiscal 2019   compared to   $2.1 billion   for   the first six months of Fiscal 2018  .  The increase in operating cash flows during the first six months of Fiscal 2019 was driven by business momentum, improved profitability, and working capital discipline.  
    
  Investing Activities       Investing activities primarily consist of cash used to fund strategic investments, the maturities, sales, and purchases of investments, capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, and capitalized software development costs.  During   the first six months of Fiscal 2019  , cash used by investing activities was   $0.2 billion   and was primarily driven by capital expenditures partially offset by the net sales of investments.  In comparison, cash used by investing activities was   $1.3 billion   during   the first six months of Fiscal 2018   and was primarily driven by capital expenditures, capitalized software development costs, and net purchases of investments.  
    
  Financing Activities     Financing activities primarily consist of the proceeds and repayments of debt, cash used to repurchase common stock, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of subsidiaries.  Cash used by financing activities of   $2.0 billion   during   the first six months of Fiscal 2019   was primarily driven repayments of debt, including the EMC Note in the amount of   $2.5 billion   we repaid during   the second quarter of Fiscal 2019  .  In comparison, cash used by financing activities of   $1.1 billion   during   the first six months of Fiscal 2018   was primarily driven by repayments of debt and share repurchases. 
    
  Capital Commitments 
    
  Capital Expenditures       During both   the first six months of Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018  , we spent   $0.6 billion   on property, plant, and equipment.  These expenditures were primarily incurred in connection with our global expansion efforts and infrastructure investments made to support future growth.  Product demand, product mix, and the use of contract manufacturers, as well as ongoing investments in operating and information technology infrastructure, influence the level and prioritization of our capital expenditures.  Aggregate capital expenditures for Fiscal 2019, which will be primarily related to infrastructure investments and strategic initiatives, are currently expected to total between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion. 
    
  Purchase Obligations     Purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us.  These obligations specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to  

88 

Table of Contents  

be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.  Purchase obligations do not include contracts that may be canceled without penalty.   
    
  We utilize several suppliers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our products.  Our efficient supply chain management allows us to enter into flexible and mutually beneficial purchase arrangements with our suppliers in order to minimize inventory risk.  Consistent with industry practice, we acquire raw materials or other goods and services, including product components, by issuing to suppliers authorizations to purchase based on our projected demand and manufacturing needs.  These purchase orders are typically fulfilled within 30 days and are entered into during the ordinary course of business in order to establish best pricing and continuity of supply for our production. 
    
  Repurchases of Common Stock 
    
  Class V Common Stock Repurchases by Dell Technologies Inc. 
    
  Since the date of the EMC merger transaction, our board of directors has authorized several programs to repurchase shares of our Class V Common Stock.  Of the   $2.1 billion   total authorized,   $676 million   remained as of   August 3, 2018  , all of which is attributable to the DHI Group Repurchase Program, which the board of directors suspended on December 13, 2016 until such time as it authorizes the reinstatement of that program. 
    
  During   the first six months of Fiscal 2019  , we did not repurchase any shares of Class V Common Stock.  During   the first six months of Fiscal 2018  , we repurchased   5.9 million   shares of Class V Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of   $382 million  .  The repurchase of these shares was funded by proceeds received by the Class V Group from the sale by a subsidiary of the Company of shares of Class A common stock of VMware, Inc. owned by such subsidiary, as discussed below.  
    
  DHI Group Common Stock Repurchases     by Dell Technologies Inc. 
    
  During the second quarter and first six months of Fiscal 2019, we repurchased an immaterial number of shares of DHI Group Common Stock for approximately   $10 million   and   $48 million  , respectively.  During the second quarter of Fiscal 2018, the Company did not repurchase any shares of DHI Group Common Stock.  During the first six months of Fiscal 2018, the Company repurchased an immaterial number of shares of DHI Group Common Stock for approximately   $2 million  . 
    
  VMware, Inc. Class A Common Stock Repurchases by VMware, Inc. 
    
  Since the date of the EMC merger transaction, VMware Inc.'s board of directors has authorized the repurchase of a total of   $2.2 billion   of VMware Inc.'s Class A common stock, of which   $876 million   remained available as of August 3, 2018. 
    
  During the first six months of Fiscal 2019, VMware, Inc. did not repurchase any shares of its Class A common stock.  During the first six months of Fiscal 2018, pursuant to stock repurchase agreements between Dell Technologies Inc. and VMware, Inc., VMware, Inc. repurchased 4.8 million shares of its Class A common stock from us for an aggregate purchase price of   $425 million  .  VMware, Inc. received the initial   4.1 million   shares of its Class A common stock during the first quarter of Fiscal 2018 and the remaining   0.7 million   shares during the second quarter of Fiscal 2018.  The proceeds from the sales were used by us to repurchase shares of our Class V Common Stock, as described above.

ITEM 3   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting us, see "Part II   Item 7A   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2018.  Our exposure to market risks has not changed materially from that set forth in our Annual Report. 

ITEM 4   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  This report includes the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by Rule 13a-14 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").  See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 filed with this report.  This Item 4 includes information concerning the controls and control evaluations referred to in those certifications. 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
    
  In connection with the preparation of this report, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   August 3, 2018  .      Based on that evaluation, our C  hief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer   have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of     August 3, 2018  . 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended   August 3, 2018   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  During the first quarter of Fiscal 2019, we implemented new revenue recognition systems and related controls to enable us to adopt the new accounting guidance set forth in ASC 606, "Revenue From Contracts With Customers."  Given the significance of these changes, we will continue to review and refine the systems, processes, and internal controls over revenue recognition, as appropriate.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  The information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the information set forth under the caption "Legal Matters" in     Note 11     of the     Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements     included in this report. 

ITEM 1A   RISK FACTORS 
    
  In addition to the risks described below and the other information set forth in this report, the factors discussed in "Part I - Item 1A - Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2018 could materially affect our business, operating results, financial condition, or prospects.  The risks described below and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent SEC reports are not the only risks facing us.  There are additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that also may materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, or prospects. 
    
  Dell Technologies  ability to generate substantial non-U.S. net revenue is subject to additional risks and uncertainties. 
    
  Sales outside the United States accounted for approximately 51% of Dell Technologies  consolidated net revenue for Fiscal 2018.  Dell Technologies  future growth rates and success are substantially dependent on the continued growth of Dell Technologies  business outside of the United States.  Dell Technologies  international operations face many risks and uncertainties, including varied local economic and labor conditions; political instability; changes in the U.S. and international regulatory environments; the impacts of trade protection measures, including increases in tariffs and trade barriers due to the current geopolitical climate and changes and instability in government policies and international trade arrangements, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct business in non-U.S. markets; tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign operations); copyright levies; and foreign currency exchange rates.  Any of these factors could negatively affect Dell Technologies  international business results and prospects for growth. 
    
  Adverse global economic conditions and instability in financial markets may harm Dell Technologies' business and result in reduced net revenue and profitability. 
    
  As a global company with customers operating in a broad range of businesses and industries, Dell Technologies' performance is affected by global economic conditions.  Adverse economic conditions may negatively affect customer demand for Dell Technologies' products and services.  Such economic conditions could result in postponed or decreased spending amid customer concerns over unemployment, reduced asset values, volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses, local and state governments, and sovereign nations.  Weak or unstable global economic conditions, including due to international trade protection measures, also could harm Dell Technologies' business by contributing to product shortages or delays, insolvency of key suppliers, customer and counterparty insolvencies, increased product costs and associated price increases, reduced global sales, and increased challenges in managing Dell Technologies' treasury operations.  Any such effects could have a negative impact on Dell Technologies' net revenue and profitability.

ITEM 2   UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
    
  Sales of Unregistered Securities 
    
  From May 5, 2018 through   August 3, 2018  , we issued to certain employees a total of   9,903   shares of our Class C Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $0.2 million   pursuant to exercises of stock options granted under the Dell Inc. Amended and Restated 2002 Long-Term Plan.  The foregoing transactions were effected in reliance on the exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 afforded by Rule 701 thereunder as transactions pursuant to compensatory benefit plans or contracts relating to compensation as provided under such rule. 
    
  Purchases of Equity Securities   
    
  On September 7, 2016, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program (the "DHI Group Repurchase Program") that authorizes us to use assets of the DHI Group to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of shares of our Class V Common Stock over a two-year period beginning on September 7, 2016.  On December 13, 2016, our board of directors approved the suspension of the DHI Group Repurchase Program until such time as the board of directors authorizes the reinstatement of that program.  The board of directors has not authorized the reinstatement of the program and we did not repurchase any shares of our Class V Common Stock during the first or second quarter of   Fiscal 2019  .  As of   August 3, 2018  , the approximate dollar value of shares of Class V Common Stock that may yet be purchased was   $676 million   authorized under the DHI Group Repurchase Program.

  I, Thomas W. Sweet, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Dell Technologies Inc.; 
              2.
