         Table of Contents             SECTOR 5, INC.      NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      JUNE 30, 2018     (Unaudited)         NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS        SECTOR 5, INC. ( Sector 5  or the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 11, 2012. On March 18, 2016 there was a change in control of the Company as a result of a private sale of the Company s common stock. The change in control includes plans to relaunch the Company to sell branded electronic products targeting the educational and consumer electronics markets.         NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES          Basis of Presentation       The Company s unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring items, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods shown and are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2018. These unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.          Use of Estimates     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.         Reclassifications       Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period financial information to conform to the presentation used in the financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018.         Fair Value of Financial Instruments         The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:       Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.       Level 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.       Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.       The carrying amount of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, accrued expenses and notes payable approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.                     6        
         Table of Contents            The following table classifies the Company s liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis into the fair value hierarchy as of:       June 30, 2018:              Derivative Financial Instruments    Derivative liabilities are recognized in the balance sheets at fair value based on the criteria specified in Financial Accounting Standards Board (  FASB  ) Accounting Standards Codification (  ASC  ) Topic 815-15    Derivatives and Hedging   Embedded Derivatives  (  ASC 815-15  ). Pursuant to ASC Topic 815-15 an evaluation of the embedded conversion feature of convertible debt is evaluated to determine if the bifurcated debt conversion feature is required to be classified as a derivative liability. Since the terms of the embedded conversion features of the Company s convertible debt provides for the issuance of shares of common stock at the election of the holders and the number of shares is subject to adjustment for a decline in the price of the Company s common stock, the Company determined that the embedded conversion option met the criteria of a derivative liability. The estimated fair value of the embedded conversion feature of debt classified as derivative liabilities are determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model utilizes Level 3 unobservable inputs to calculate the fair value of the derivative liabilities at each reporting period.        The Company determined that using an alternative valuation model such as a Binomial-Lattice model would result in minimal differences. The fair value of the embedded conversion feature of debt classified as derivative liabilities are adjusted for changes in fair value at each reporting period, and the corresponding non-cash gain or loss is recorded as other income or expense in the statement of operations. As of June 30, 2018, the embedded conversion feature of $607,195 of convertible notes payable was classified as a derivative liability. Each reporting period the embedded conversion feature is re-valued and adjusted through the caption  change in fair value of derivative  on the statements of operations.         Revenue and cost recognition     Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that an entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.       The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations the Company must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company recognizes as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Generally, the Company s performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time, typically upon delivery.         Accounts Receivable     Revenues that have been recognized but not yet received are recorded as accounts receivable. Losses on receivables will be recognized when it is more likely than not that a receivable will not be collected. An allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts will be recognized to reduce the amount of receivables to its net realizable value. Any allowance for uncollectible amounts is evaluated quarterly.         Recently issued accounting pronouncements     The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.                     7        
         Table of Contents             NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN        As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $1,484,748 at June 30, 2018 and had a net loss of $968,721 for the six months ended June 30, 2018. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.       While the Company is attempting to increase operations and revenues, our cash position may not be significant enough to support our daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of debt and equity financing. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement our business plan and generate increased revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate increased revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the ability to further implement its business plan and generate increased revenues. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern.

Liquidity and Capital Resources        We measure our liquidity in a number of ways, including the following:             The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.       In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources.

The first tranche of $420,000, net of $38,000 of OID and fees was received on August 7, 2018.        Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Note 2 to the Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements.       We are subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired, or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.       We recognize deferred tax assets (future tax benefits) and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the expected future tax return consequences of those differences, which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Future tax benefits have been fully offset by a 100% valuation allowance as management is unable to determine that it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will be realized.         Off Balance Sheet Arrangements         We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.         Material Commitments         On March 29, 2018, the Company received a purchase order for 10,000 Chromebooks for expected revenue of $1,345,000. As of June 30, 2018, 1,000 units have been shipped. The Company is still in the process of fulfilling the order; however, it may encounter difficulty fulfilling the entire order due to the unavailability of certain components.                  Recent Accounting Pronouncements         The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.          Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk         Disclosure under this section is not required for a smaller reporting company.         Item 4. Controls and Procedures         We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Treasurer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.       As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Treasurer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the quarter covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2018. It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.         Management s Remediation Initiatives         In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we plan to initiate the following series of measures once we have the financial resources to do so:                          We will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us. And, we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee, which will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us.                             Management believes that the appointment of outside directors to a fully functioning audit committee, would remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee.            Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting         There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report, which were identified in connection with management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.                  PART II OTHER INFORMATION       Item 1. Legal Proceedings         There are not presently any material pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or as to which any of our property is subject, and no such proceedings are known to the Company to be threatened or contemplated against it.         Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.         None.         Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities         None.         Item 4.
