NOTE
A - ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS  

Enviro Technologies,
Inc., an Idaho corporation (the  Company ), is a manufacturer of environmental and industrial separation technology.
The Company developed, and now manufactures the Voraxial    Separator for Cameron Solutions, Inc., an affiliate of
Schlumberger Technology Corporation. The Voraxial is a patented technology that was developed by the Company and sold to Schlumberger
Technology Corporation, a Texas corporation. Pursuant to the agreements we signed with Schlumberger Technology Corporation, we
received a Grant Back license to manufacture, market and sell the technology for industries outside of the oil and gas markets
such as mining, sewage, wastewater, among others.  

Florida Precision
Aerospace, Inc., a Florida corporation ( FPA ), is the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is used to manufacture,
assemble and test the Voraxial Separator. Effective November 10, 2017 the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation,
changing the Company s name from  Enviro Voraxial Technology, Inc.  to  Enviro Technologies, Inc. 
and increasing its authorized common stock to 250,000,000 shares.  

NOTE
B   GOING CONCERN  

While the Company
has historically experienced recurring net losses, on June 8, 2017, the Company completed a Technology Purchase Agreement with
Schlumberger Technology Corporation, Schlumberger Canada Limited, a Canadian entity, and Schlumberger B.V., an entity organized
under the laws of the Netherlands (collectively,  Schlumberger ) for the sale of the Company s
intellectual property in consideration of up to $4,000,000, of which $3,000,000 was paid at closing and $1,000,000 is payable
upon the completion of both: (i) the complete transfer of the intellectually property to Schlumberger; and (ii) the provision
to transfer information, assets and services to Schlumberger, which is estimated to be completed by September 2018. In addition,
at closing FPA entered into a Framework Agreement (the  Supply Agreement ) with Cameron Solutions, Inc. ( Cameron
Solutions ), a Houston, Texas-based company engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of equipment used in the oil
and gas industry. Under the terms of the three-year Supply Agreement, FPA is the exclusive supplier to Cameron Solutions of certain
Voraxial series products for use in the oil and gas industry. Pursuant to the Technology Purchase Agreement, Schlumberger also
granted us non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free licenses (the  Grant Back Licenses ) for the sale of Voraxial products
outside the oil and gas industry. Our management believes that the Grant Back Licenses will provide us the opportunity to possibly
leverage future Schlumberger sales in the oil and gas market to penetrate the sale and use of licensed Voraxial products to other
industries, including, but not limited to mining, sewage and wastewater.  

We believe that
including our current cash resources and anticipated revenue to be generated under the Grant Back Licenses and Supply Agreement,
we will have sufficient resources to continue business operations in excess of 12 months. However, we have not yet generated significant
revenues from the Supply Agreement or Grant Back Licenses. There is no assurance that the Supply Agreement will generate sufficient
revenues and income, nor is there any assurance that we will be able to leverage the Grant Back Licenses and generate sufficient
revenues from other industries.  

At June 30,
2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $15,613,636 including a net loss of $624,842 for the six months ended June 30, 2018. We
may not be able to achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we fail to achieve profitability on a quarterly or
annual basis, or to raise additional funds when needed, or do not have sufficient cash flows from sales, we may be required to
scale back or cease operations, sell or liquidate our assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection. As a result of the above,
there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and the accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.

NOTE
C - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Interim
Financial Statements   

The
interim financial statements presented herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant
to such rules and regulations. The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company s annual
financial statements, notes and accounting policies included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC on April 12, 2018. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which are necessary
to provide a fair presentation of financial position as of June 30, 2018, and the related operating results and cash flows for
the interim period presented, have been made. The results of operations, for the period presented are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for the year.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company, Enviro Technologies, Inc., and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, FPA. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  

Estimates   

The preparation
of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ. Significant estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts,
deferred tax asset, allowance for inventory obsolescence and valuation of stock-based compensation.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company derives its revenue from the sale and short-term rental of the Voraxial Separator. We account for revenue in accordance
with ASC Topic 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of ASC Topic 606
did not have a material impact on the timing or amounts of revenue recognized in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and therefore did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, equity or cash flows
as of the adoption date or for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018. We did not recognize any cumulative-effect adjustment
to retained earnings upon adoption as the impact was immaterial. Also, the comparative information has not been restated and continues
to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.  

Revenues are
recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised goods or services to our customers
at a point in time, in an amount specified in the contract with our customer and that reflects the consideration we expect to
be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company also assesses our customer s ability and intention to
pay, which is based on a variety of factors including our customer s historical payment experience and financial condition.

Revenues that
are generated from sales of equipment are typically recognized upon shipment. Our standard agreements generally do not include
customer acceptance or post shipment installation provisions. However, if such provisions have been included or there is an uncertainty
about customer order, revenue is deferred until we have evidence of customer order and all terms of the agreement have been complied
with. As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, there was $690,471 and $32,090, respectively, of deposits from customers. The
increase in deposit from customer is mostly attributable to the purchase order we received from a utility company for a wastewater
treatment system that is comprised of 3 Voraxial Separators.  

The Company
recognizes revenue from the short-term rental of equipment, ratably over the life of the agreement, which is usually one to twelve
months.  

ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE   

Accounts
receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses. The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific allowance when
there is a doubt as to the collectability of individual balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances,
the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balance, customer s historical payment history, and its current
credit-worthiness and current economic trends. Accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts at collections. At June 30, 2018
and December 31, 2017, the Company had $60,254 and $60,254 in the allowance for doubtful accounts, respectively.  

Fair
Value of Instruments   

The carrying
amounts of the Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses
at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, approximate their fair value because of their relatively short-term nature.  

ASC 820  Disclosures
about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,  requires disclosures of information regarding the fair value of certain financial
instruments for which it is practicable to estimate the value. For purpose of this disclosure, the fair value of a financial instrument
is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
sale of liquidation.  

The Company
accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent
to which inputs used in measuring fair value is observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements
in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
These levels are:  

Level 1 inputs
are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. We have no Level 1 instruments as
of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.  

Level 2 inputs
are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs
are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or
liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using
market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies
and commodities. We have no Level 2 instruments as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

Level 3 inputs
are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use
in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing
models and discounted cash flow models. We have no Level 3 instruments as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The Company
considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
The Company maintains its cash balances with various financial institutions. Balances at these institutions may at times exceed
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporate ( FDIC ) limits. As of June 30, 2018, the Company has a cash concentration
of $715,943 in excess of FDIC limits.  

Inventory   

Inventory consists
of components for the Voraxial Separator and is priced at lower of cost or market. Inventory may include units being rented on
a short-term basis or components held by third parties in connection with pilot programs as part of the continuing evaluation
by such third parties as to the effectiveness and usefulness of the service to be incorporated into their respective operations.
The third parties do not have a contractual obligation to purchase the equipment. The Company maintains the title and risk of
loss. Therefore, these units are included in the inventory of the Company. As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017:  

Inventory amounts
are presented net of impairment of $42,752 and $42,752 as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.  

Fixed
Assets   

Fixed assets
are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed to operations as incurred. Depreciation
is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated economic useful life of the assets (5-10 years). Gains and losses recognized
from the sales or disposal of assets is the difference between the sales price and the recorded cost less accumulated depreciation
less costs of disposal.  

In July 2017,
the Company entered into a financing agreement for the purchase of CNC machining equipment valued at approximately $426,000. The
machining equipment was received in July 2017 and is being used for the manufacture of Voraxial Separators in manufacturing current
and potential future orders under the Supply Agreement and sales pursuant to the Grant Back Licenses. Under the terms of the agreement
the Company made an initial down payment of $85,661 and is required to make monthly payments of $6,788 through January 2023. In
addition, the Company incurred $24,281 of installation costs.

Net
INCOME (Loss) Per Share   

In accordance
with the accounting guidance now codified as ASC Topic 260,   Earnings per Share   basic earnings (loss) per
share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period.  

As the
Company had net loss for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2018, the effect of 13,465,000 and 13,465,000
options, respectively, are anti-dilutive. A separate computation of diluted loss per share is not presented. The Company had
net income for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2017, the effect of 13,465,000 and 13,645,000 options,
respectively are dilutive. A separate computation of diluted earnings per share is presented using the treasury stock
method.  

INCOME TAXES   

The Company
accounts for income taxes under ASC 740-10-25 ( ASC 740-10-25 ). Under ASC 740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. Under ASC 740-10-25, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date.  

BUSINESS
SEGMENTS   

  The Company
operates in one segment and therefore segment information is not presented.  

Research
and Development Expenses   

Research and
development costs, which includes travel expenses, consulting fees, subcontractors and salaries are expensed as incurred.  

Advertising
Costs   

Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

The Company
accounts for stock-based instruments issued to employees for services in accordance with ASC 718  Compensation   Stock
Compensation.  ASC 718 requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock
options and other equity based compensation issued to employees. The value of the portion of an employee award that is ultimately
expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods using the straight-line attribution method. The
Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with the measurement and recognition criteria of ASC 505-50,
 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.   

RECLASSIFICATIONS   

Certain amounts
from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no impact
on the Company s net loss or cashflows.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In February
2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which will amend current lease accounting to require lessees to recognize (i) a lease
liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and
(ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified
asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors; however,
certain changes were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model. This standard will be
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently
reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial
condition.  

In
August 2015, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date   defers the effective date ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by one year.
Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in Update
2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting
period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim
reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2019. All other entities may apply the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after
December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities also may apply the guidance
in Update 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods within
annual reporting periods beginning one year after the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the guidance in
ASU No. 2014-09.  The Company adopted these standards on January 1, 2018.  The
adoption did not have a material impact on the timing or amounts of revenue recognized in our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements and therefore did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, equity or
cash flows as of the adoption date or for the three months ended June 30, 2018. We did not recognize any cumulative-effect adjustment
to retained earnings upon adoption as the impact was immaterial. Also, the comparative information has not been restated and continues
to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.  

All other newly
issued accounting pronouncements, but not yet effective, have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.  

NOTE

Compensation.  ASC 718 requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock
options and other equity based compensation issued to employees. The value of the portion of an employee award that is ultimately
expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite
service periods

using  the
straight-line attribution method. The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with the measurement
and recognition criteria of ASC 505-50,  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.  The Company estimates the fair
value of stock options by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  

The
Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions
including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company s stock options and warrants have characteristics different
from those of its traded stock, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate,
in management s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of such
stock options. The risk-free interest rate is based upon quoted market yields for United States Treasury debt securities with
a term similar to the expected term. The expected dividend yield is based upon the Company s history of having never issued
a dividend and management s current expectation of future action surrounding dividends. Expected volatility was based on
historical data for the   trading  of
our stock on the open market. The expected lives for such grants were based on the simplified method for employees and officers.   

Information
with respect to options outstanding and exercisable at June 30, 2018 is as follows:  

The aggregate
intrinsic value represents the excess amount over the exercise price optionees would have received if all the options have been
exercised on the last business day of the period indicated based on the Company s closing stock price of for such day. The
aggregate intrinsic value as of June 30, 2018 is $387,850.

EQUIPMENT
FINANCING   

In
July 2017, the Company entered into a financing agreement for the purchase of CNC machining equipment valued at approximately
$426,000. The machining equipment was received in July 2017 and will be used for the manufacture of Voraxial Separators in preparation
of potential future orders under the Supply Agreement and sales pursuant to the Grant Back Licenses. As of June 30, 2018 and December
31, 2017, the amount owed is $  320,344  and
$340,644 respectively.   

Litigation   

On or about
October 23, 2017, a claim was filed in the 17 th  Judicial Circuit Court in and for Broward County in Fort Lauderdale,
Florida, by the plaintiff, Industrial and Oilfield Procurement Services, LLC, against the Company. The case involves an
alleged breach of contract between the parties relating to the purchase and sale of a Voraxial unit in 2015. The plaintiff
has demanded a refund and damages. We are defending this action, as we believe this claim is without merit.  

SALE OF INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY   

On June 8, 2017,
the Company and FPA, our wholly owned subsidiary,  closed the transactions contemplated
by the Technology Purchase Agreement dated March 13, 2017 with Schlumberger.  

At closing,
we sold our intellectual property (the  Purchased Intellectual Property ), substantially consisting of the Voraxial
patents, marks, software and copyrights, to Schlumberger in consideration of up to $4,000,000, of which $3,000,000 was paid to
us at closing and $1,000,000 is payable upon the completion of both: (i) the complete transfer of the Purchased Intellectually
Property to Schlumberger; and (ii) the provision to transfer information, assets and services to Schlumberger, which is estimated
to be by September 2018. We recognized a gain on the sale of our intellectual property of $3,000,000 less direct costs of $80,000,
consisting of a termination fee and consulting fees.  

We utilized
a portion of the proceeds from this transaction to pay some of our outstanding debt and are using the balance for general working
capital. We are also using some of the proceeds to buy additional manufacturing equipment to meet potential future sales.  

As part of the
agreement, Schlumberger granted us Grant Back Licenses to make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import products and processes embodying
the Purchase Intellectual Property outside the oil and gas market. In addition to the proceeds from the sale of our intellectual
property, our management believes that the Grant Back License will provide for the potential increase of revenues through the
sale of Voraxial Separators, possibly leveraging future sales by Schlumberger in the oil and gas market to penetrate the sale
and use of licensed Voraxial products to other industries, including, but not limited to mining, sewage and wastewater.  

In addition,
at closing FPA entered into the Supply Agreement with Cameron Solutions. Under the terms of the three-year Supply Agreement, FPA
is the exclusive supplier to Cameron Solutions of certain Voraxial series products for use in the oil and gas industry. Sales
will be made from time to time in accordance with the terms of purchase orders. The Supply Agreement is cancellable by Cameron
Solutions upon 15 days  notice if FPA fails to meet delivery or performance schedules or breaches any of the terms of the
agreement, including the warranties. Cameron Solutions may also cancel the Supply Agreement without notice in the event FPA becomes
insolvent or commits any act of bankruptcy. The Supply Agreement contains customary indemnification and confidentiality provisions.

Overview  

Enviro Technologies,
Inc. was incorporated in Idaho on October 19, 1964, under the name Idaho Silver, Inc. Florida Precision Aerospace, Inc.,
our wholly owned subsidiary, was incorporated on February 26, 1993. The Company developed and now manufactures and sells the patented
Voraxial    Separator pursuant to the agreements discussed below. The Voraxial    Separator is a proprietary
technology now owned by Cameron Solutions, Inc., an affiliate of Schlumberger Technology Corporation that efficiently separates
large volumes of liquid/liquid, liquid/solids or liquid/liquid/solids fluid mixtures with distinct specific gravities.  

On March 13,
2017, we entered into a Technology Purchase Agreement with Schlumberger Technology Corporation, a Texas corporation, Schlumberger
Canada Limited, a Canadian entity, and Schlumberger B.V., an entity organized under the laws of the Netherlands (collectively,
 Schlumberger ) which was approved by the Company s shareholders on May 31, 2017 and completed on June 8, 2017.
Under the agreement we sold our intellectual property (the  Purchased Intellectual Property ), substantially consisting
of the Voraxial patents, marks, software and copyrights, to Schlumberger in consideration of up to $4,000,000, of which $3,000,000
was paid to us at closing. The remaining $1,000,000 is payable upon the completion of both: (i) the complete transfer of the Purchased
Intellectually Property to Schlumberger; and (ii) the provision to transfer information, assets and services
to Schlumberger, which is estimated to be completed by September, 2018.  

Table of Contents   

Pursuant to
the agreements we signed with Schlumberger, we shall continue to manufacture the technology for Schlumberger for the oil and gas
industry and are able to pursue other industries independent of Schlumberger, which include mining, sewage, wastewater as well
as other markets. We have focused our resources immediately after the transaction developing the relationship with Schlumberger
and preparing and upgrading our manufacturing capabilities to meet the potential increase in Voraxial demand from the oil and
gas markets resulting in an increase in our SG A.  

As part of the
agreement, Schlumberger granted us a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free licenses (the  Grant Back
Licenses ), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import products and processes embodying the Purchase Intellectual Property
outside the oil and gas market. We believe that the Grant Back Licenses will provide for potential revenue growth through the
sale of Voraxial Separators outside the oil and gas industry, including, but not limited to mining, sewage and industrial wastewater.
Although there are no assurances that we will generate substantial revenues under the Grant Back License we believe these opportunities
to serve industries outside of the oil and gas markets will continue to increase.  

We have started
transitioning our sales and marketing activities to market outside of oil and gas. We received a purchase order from a utility
company for a wastewater system that will require multiple Voraxial Separator units. The wastewater system we anticipate shipping
by first quarter of 2019 will be utilized to separate oil and solids prior to the water being discharged into the environment.
The increase in our deposits is a result of this purchase order.  

In addition,
at closing FPA entered into a Framework Agreement (the  Supply Agreement ) with Cameron Solutions, Inc. ( Cameron
Solutions ), a Houston, Texas-based company engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of equipment used in the oil
and gas industry. Under the terms of the three-year Supply Agreement, FPA is the exclusive supplier to Cameron Solutions of certain
Voraxial series products for use in the oil and gas industry. The Supply Agreement is cancellable by Cameron Solutions upon 15
days  notice if FPA fails to meet delivery or performance schedules or breaches any of the terms
of the agreement, including the warranties. The Supply Agreement contains customary indemnification and confidentiality provisions.
Although there are no assurances that we will generate substantial revenues under the Supply Agreement, we have begun receiving
orders from and shipping to Cameron Solutions.  

For a period
of three years following the closing of the Technology Purchase Agreement, the Company and Raynard Veldman and John Di Bella have
agreed to not participate or cause participation in the oil-and-gas market in relation to phase or constituent sensing or separation
which is defined as, liquid-liquid, liquid-solid or liquid-gas separation and gas or liquid sensing, including all product lines
and services related thereto and including the Voraxial product line and services, except to the extent necessary to: (i) repair
or service, but not remanufacture, any goods the Company sold to third persons prior to closing; (ii) fulfill, on or after closing,
any customer obligation; or (iii) comply with any term or condition of the agreement. In addition the Company shall take all reasonable
measures to ensure the confidentiality and prevent the improper use of all trade secrets.  

Table of Contents   

Results
of Operations for the Three Months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:  

Revenue   

Our revenues
decreased by $16,998 or approximately 58% to $12,063 for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $29,061 for the three
months ended June 30, 2017.  The decrease in revenues corresponds with
the transition we are experiencing due to the Technology Purchase Agreement we consummated with Schlumberger and related transactions.
We believe there is a market for the Voraxial Separator and that  these agreements will provide us with the opportunity
to substantially increase revenues in the future in both the oil and gas industry and potentially other industries as well, such
as mining, sewage and industrial wastewater through the Grant Back Licenses. Although we have begun receiving orders as a result
of the  Technology Purchase Agreement,  there are no assurances
that we are correct and it is possible we will not be successful in our efforts to exploit these additional opportunities.  

Additionally,
we received a purchase order from a utility company for a wastewater system that will require multiple Voraxial
Separator units. The wastewater system we anticipate shipping by first quarter of 2019 will be utilized to separate oil and
solids prior to the water being discharged into the environment. The increase in our deposits from customer is a result of
this purchase order.  

Cost
of Goods    

Our cost of
goods decreased by 83% to $3,091 for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $18,404 for the three months ended June
30, 2017. This decrease is mainly due to the decrease in sales and the use of previously written off inventory during the three
months ended June 30, 2018. Our cost of goods continues to be reviewed by management in effort to obtain the best available pricing
while maintaining high quality standards.  

Costs
and Expenses   

Total costs
and expenses increased by $217,010 or approximately 108% to $416,927 for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $199,917
for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Our costs and expenses increased from the second quarter of the previous year as we
incurred an increase in SG A which is due to the increase activity in the sales and marketing of the Voraxial, increase in
maintenance and repair associated with the increase use of equipment and manufacturing activity, and an increase in depreciation
expense from recently acquired manufacturing equipment. The increase in our professional fees and payroll reflects the increase
in consulting payments and a non-cash expense of $115,000 associated with the restricted stock issuance to Messrs. DiBella and
Veldman and as compensation for services pursuant to the terms of a business advisory consulting agreement. This was offset partially
by a decrease in our payroll as our CEO reduced his salary by $23,750 during the three months ended June 30, 2018.  

Results of Operations for
the Six Months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:   

   Revenue   

Our revenues increased by 5% to $125,990
for the six months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $120,412 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  

Our revenues
were relatively flat year over year.  The modest increase in revenues
corresponds with the transition we are experiencing due to the Technology Purchase Agreement we consummated with Schlumberger
and related transactions. We believe there is a market for the Voraxial Separator and that  these agreements will provide
us with the opportunity to substantially increase revenues in the future in both the oil and gas industry and potentially other
industries as well, such as mining, sewage and industrial wastewater through the Grant Back Licenses. Although we have begun receiving
orders   

Table of Contents   

as a result of the  Technology
Purchase Agreement,  there are no assurances that we are correct and it is possible we will not be successful in our efforts
to exploit these additional opportunities. 

Additionally,
we received a purchase order from a utility company for a wastewater system that will require multiple Voraxial
Separator units. The wastewater system we anticipate shipping by first quarter of 2019 will be utilized to separate oil and
solids prior to the water being discharged into the environment. The increase in our deposits from customer is a result of
this purchase order.  

Cost
of Goods   

Our cost of
goods increased to $70,288 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $42,563 for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
This increase is due to the different models and parts sold during the six months ended June 30, 2017. Additionally, in the six
months ended June 30, 2017, we were able to use previously written off inventory which reduced our cost of goods for that period.
Our cost of goods continues to be reviewed by management to guarantee the best available pricing while maintaining high quality
standards.  

Costs
and Expenses   

Total
costs and expenses increased by $276,854 or approximately 70% to $666,904 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 from $390,050
for the six months ended June 30, 2017.   

Our costs and
expenses increased from the previous year as we incurred an increase in SG A which is due to the increase activity in the
sales and marketing of the Voraxial, increase in maintenance and repair associated with the increase use of equipment for manufacturing
activity, and an increase in depreciation expense from recently acquired equipment used to manufacture the Voraxial Separator.
The increase in our professional fees and payroll reflects the increase in consulting payments and a non-cash expense of $115,000
associated with the restricted stock issuance to Messrs. DiBella and Veldman and as compensation for services pursuant to the
terms of a business advisory consulting agreement. This was offset partially by a decrease in our payroll as our CEO reduced his
salary by $47,500 during the six months ended June 30, 2018.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources:  

Cash at June
30, 2018 was $953,055 as compared to $1,010,434 at December 31, 2017. Working capital deficit at June 30, 2018 was $684,829 as
compared to a working capital deficit at December 31, 2017 of $166,137. At June 30, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $15,613,636.
Our current assets increased by 21.4% at June 30, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017, which reflects increases in our inventory
as a result of the units we are manufacturing in fulfillment of orders we received and units we are manufacturing in fulfillment
of the Technology Purchase Agreement. Our current liabilities increased 53.4% at June 30, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017,
which is primarily attributable to a significant increase in deposits from customers as a result of the purchase order we received
from a utility company.  

Table of Contents   

Summary of
cash flows   

Net
cash used in operating activities in the six months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily attributable to net loss and increase in
inventory, offset in part by an increase in deposit from customer. Increase in our inventory is a result of the units we are manufacturing
in fulfillment of orders we received and units we are manufacturing in fulfillment of the Technology Purchase Agreement. Increase
in deposit from customer is primarily attributable to deposit received on a purchase order we received from a utility company.
Net cash used in operating activities in the six months ended June 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to the completion of the
Technology Purchase Agreement resulting in a gain on the sale of our intellectual property of $3,000,000 less direct costs of
$80,000, offset by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses.  

Net
cash used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily attributable to the repayment of the
equipment note payable. Net cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2017 was primarily attributable
to the proceeds from unsecured notes payable and advances from the Company s Chief Executive Officer, offset by repayments
of unsecured notes payable and advances from the Company s Chief Executive Officer.  

Continuing
Losses  

While
the Company has historically experienced recurring net losses, our management believes that the Grant Back Licenses will provide
us the opportunity to possibly leverage future Schlumberger sales in the oil and gas market to penetrate the sale and use of licensed
Voraxial products to other industries, including, but not limited to mining, sewage and wastewater. We believe that including
our current cash resources and anticipated revenue to be generated under the Grant Back Licenses and Supply Agreement, we will
have sufficient resources to continue business operations in excess of 12 months. However, there are no assurances
that we will generate any or significant revenues under the Supply Agreement or Grant Back Licenses and there is limited historical
financial data and operating results with which to evaluate our business and our prospects under the new agreements.  

Our
ability to generate future revenues will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include
competitive efforts and general economic trends. Due to these factors, we cannot anticipate with any degree of certainty what
our revenues will be in future periods. Our independent auditors have included in their audit report for the years ended December
31, 2017 and 2016 an explanatory paragraph that states that our continuing losses from operations raises substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. Although we achieved profitability in 2017, such profit was due to the closing of
the Technology Purchase Agreement. At June 30, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $15,613,636 including a net loss of $624,842
for the six months ended June 30, 2018. We anticipate receiving the remaining $1,000,000 by September 2018 in fulfillment of the
Technology Purchase Agreement signed with Schlumberger in June 2017. We may not be able to achieve profitability on a quarterly
or annual basis. If we fail to achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis, or to receive the remaining fund from the
Technology Purchase Agreement, or to raise additional funds when needed, or do not have sufficient cash flows from sales, we may
be required to scale back or cease operations, sell or liquidate our assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection.  

Table of Contents   

As
a result of the above, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and the accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.   

Off balance
sheet arrangements   

As
of the date of this report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term  off-balance sheet arrangement 
generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party,
under which we have any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained
or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market
risk support for such assets.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We maintain
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the  Exchange Act ) that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required
to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

The Company s
management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer who also serves as our Chief
Financial (and principal accounting) Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2018.
Based upon continuing material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting as described in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, our management concluded that the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this report.

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures  

Our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further,
the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These
inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons,
by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based
in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations
in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There were no
changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1.       Legal
                                         Proceedings    

As
previously discussed, on or about October 23, 2017, a claim was filed in the 17 th  Judicial Circuit Court in and for
Broward County in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, by the plaintiff, Industrial and Oilfield Procurement Services, LLC, against our company.
 The case involves an alleged breach of contract between the parties relating to the purchase and sale of a Voraxial unit
in 2015. The plaintiff has demanded a refund and damages. We are defending this action, as we believe this claim is without
merit.
