Company

Wan Hong International Holding Limited (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 31, 2014

shares of common stock from existing shareholders. After the transaction our management is currently working on a new business
plan and winding up the current business plan. The Company plans to operate in tea related business(es) in China, but there is
no guarantee that the Company will be successful in its endeavor.

Market
Information    

There
is a limited public market for our common shares. Our common shares are quoted on the OTC Pink Sheets at $0.10 this time and have
been during the previous two years. Trading in stocks quoted on the OTC Pink Sheets is often thin and is characterized by wide
fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may be unrelated to a company s operations or business prospects.
We cannot assure you that there will be a market in the future for our common stock.  

OTC
Pink Sheet securities are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC
Pink Sheet securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks.  

Holders    

As
of August 31, 2018, the 8,100,000 issued and outstanding shares of common stock were held by a total of three shareholders of
record.  

Compensation
Plans    

The
Company has no securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans.  

Dividends    

No
cash dividends were paid on our shares of common stock during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018. We have not paid any cash dividends
since January 31, 2014 (inception) and do not foresee declaring any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.

7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere
in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs.
Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Our audited financial statements
are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  

General    

On
January 14, 2017, Shu Feng Lu, Hong Xia Li, and Chen Yang took control of the Company by purchasing shares of common stock from
existing shareholders. After the transaction our management is currently working on new business plan and winding up the current
business plan. The Company plans on operating in cultural related business in the future, but there are no definitive agreements
in place.

Results
Of Operations    

We
have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going
concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.  

We
expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital
through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.  

Fiscal
Year Ended May 31, 2018 Compared To May 31, 2017.    

Revenue    

We
recognized revenue of $0 for the year ended May 31, 2018 and the year ended May 31, 2017.  

Operating
expenses    

We
incurred operating expenses of $35,443 for the year ended May 31, 2018 compared to $23,838 for the year ended May 31, 2017. The
increase in operating expenses was due to an increase in expenses related to reinstatement of business license and related expenditures.  

Net
Losses    

Our
net loss for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018 was $35,443 compared to a net loss of $23,838 as of May 31, 2017 due to an increase
in operating expenses and a lack of revenues.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

As
of May 31, 2018, our total assets were $0. Our total liabilities were $59,281. As of May 31, 2017, our total assets were $5,000,
comprised of cash and cash equivalents, due to a prepayment to OTC markets. Our total liabilities were $28,838.  

Shareholders 
equity has decreased from$(23,838) as of May 31, 2017 to $(59,281) as of May 31, 2018. Deficit was due to the increase in operating
expenses.  

The
Company has accumulated a deficit of $(97,981) as of May 31, 2018 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its
business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with sales, loans from directors and, or, the private
placement of common stock.  

Management
anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses
The Company intends to position itself so that it may be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light
of management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or
become financially viable and continue as a going concern.  

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities    

We
have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018, net cash flows used
in operating activities was $30,443 compared to $28,238 for May 31, 2017.  

5   

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities    

We
neither used nor generated cash from investing activities for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018 and May 31, 2017.  

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities    

For
the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $30,443, due to loans from directors with no
interest and are due upon demand. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $28,238,
due to loans from directors.  

Plan
of Operation and Funding    

We
expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds, sales, loans
from a director and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the
growth of our business  

We
have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the loans
from management. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital
expenditures relating to:   

Legal
and professional fees  

Business
Development  

We
intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, debt issuances and sales. Thereafter, we expect we will
need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity
or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights,
preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all.
If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective
new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.  

Material
Commitments    

As
of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments.  

Purchase
of Significant Equipment    

We
have not purchased any significant equipment during the last twelve months.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

As
of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have
a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  

Going
Concern    

The
Company has generated limited revenues and incurred a loss since inception (January 31, 2014) resulting in an accumulated deficit
of $(97,981) as of May 31, 2018 and further losses are anticipated in the development of our business. Accordingly, there is substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

Because
of the Company s history of losses, our independent auditors, in the reports on the financial statements for the year ended
May 31, 2018 and May 31, 2017, expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities
that could result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Significant
Accounting Policies    

Basis
of Presentation    

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America, and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC )
and reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which management believes are necessary to fairly present
the financial position, results of operations, stockholders  equity and cash flows of the Company for the year ending May
31, 2018.  

Accounting
Basis    

The
Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP 
accounting). The Company has adopted a May 31 fiscal year end.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents    

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The
Company had $0 of cash as of May 31, 2018.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents and amounts due to shareholder. The carrying amount
of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing
market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.  

Inventories    

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is principally determined using the first-in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company
had $0 in inventory as of May 31, 2018.  

Depreciation,
Amortization, and Capitalization     

The
Company records depreciation and amortization when appropriate using both straight-line and declining balance methods over the
estimated useful life of the assets (five to seven years). Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred. Additions, major renewals and replacements that increase the property s useful life are capitalized. Property
sold or retired, together with the related accumulated depreciation is removed from the appropriated accounts and the resultant
gain or loss is included in net income.  

Income
Taxes    

Income
taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and
are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax
assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  

7   

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company recognizes revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured.  

Stock-Based
Compensation    

Stock-based
compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 718. To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option
plan and has not granted any stock options.  

Basic
Income (Loss) Per Share    

Basic
income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net
income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted
weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt
or equity. There are no such common stock equivalents outstanding as of May 31, 2018.  

Comprehensive
Income    

The
Company has established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances.
When applicable, the Company would disclose this information on its Statement of Stockholders  Equity. Comprehensive income
comprises equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The Company has not had any significant
transactions that are required to be reported in other comprehensive income.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

The
Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company s
results of operations, financial position or cash flow.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

To
the Board of Directors   

  Jin
Wan Hong International Holding Limited.  

Opinion
on the Financial Statements    

  We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Jin Wan Hong International Holding Limited as of May 31, 2018 and 2017 and the
related statements of operations, changes in stockholder s deficit, cash flows, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as  financial statements ) for the periods then ended. In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2018 and 2017 and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the periods then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.  

Basis
for Opinion    

  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.  

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error
or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
#2 to the financial statements, although the Company has limited operations it has yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan in regard to these matters is also described in
Note #2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

1.      NATURE
                                         OF OPERATIONS     

Jin
Wan Hong International Holding Limited, formerly Karnet Capital Corp. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State
of Nevada on January 31, 2014. On January 14, 2017, Shu Feng Lu (President and Director of the Company), Hong Xia Li, and Chen
Yang took control of the Company by purchasing shares of common stock from existing shareholders.  

The
Company s currently operates in Room 1101, Block E, Guang Hua Yuan, 2031 Bin He Nan Road, FuTian District, Shenzhen, Guangdong,
China. The Company plans to operate in tea related business(es) in China, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful
in its endeavor.  

2.      GOING
                                         CONCERN     

The
Company has generated limited revenues and incurred a loss since Inception (January 31, 2014) resulting in an accumulated deficit
of $97,981 as of May 31, 2018 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. Accordingly, there is substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors
and, or, the private placement of common stock.  

Because
of the Company s history of losses, its independent auditors, in the reports on the financial statements for the year ended
May 31, 2018, expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying audited
financial statements for the twelve months period ended May 31, 2018 have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that could result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Management
anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses
The Company intends to position itself so that it may be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light
of management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or
become financially viable and continue as a going concern.

3.      SUMMARY
                                         OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States of America, and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC )
and reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which management believes are necessary to fairly present
the financial position, results of operations, stockholders  equity and cash flows of the Company for the twelve month period
ended May 31, 2018.  

Accounting
Basis   

The
Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP 
accounting). The Company has adopted a May 31 fiscal year end.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There
were no cash equivalents as of May 31, 2018.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents and amounts due to a shareholder/director . The carrying
amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate
prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.  

Income
Taxes   

Income
taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and
are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax
assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.  

4.     SUMMARY
                                         OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)     

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will
recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned
when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped
or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is
reasonably assured.  

F- 7   

Stock-Based
Compensation   

We
account for equity-based transactions with nonemployees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50,  Equity-Based Payments
to Non-Employees  ( ASC 505-50 ). ASC 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with nonemployees
shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever
is more reliably measurable. The fair value of common stock issued for payments to nonemployees is measured at the market price
on the date of grant. The fair value of equity instruments, other than common stock, is estimated using the Black-Scholes option
valuation model. In general, we recognize the fair value of the equity instruments issued as deferred stock compensation and amortize
the cost over the term of the contract.  

We
account for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718,  Compensation Stock
Compensation,  which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the financial statements based on their fair values.  

The
fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and credited to additional paid-in capital over
the period during which services are rendered.  

Basic
Income (Loss) Per Share   

Basic
income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net
income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted
weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt
or equity. There are no such common stock equivalents outstanding as of May 31, 2018 or May 31, 2017.  

3.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update  ASU  2014-15 on  Presentation of Financial Statements
Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
( Update ). Currently, there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management s responsibility to evaluate whether
there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures.
The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing
and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going
concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the
amendments (1) provide a definition of the term  substantial doubt,  (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including
interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management s plans, (4) require certain
disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management s plans, (5) require an express
statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year
after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this Update are effective
for public and nonpublic entities for annual periods ending after May 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted.  

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact
on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting
pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.  

5.      LOAN
                                         FROM DIRECTOR     

As
of May 31, 2018, the Company owed its President, Director, and major shareholder, Shu Feng Lu $58,681. The total loan of $58,681
was unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand.

6.      PREPAYMENT     

There
was no prepayment as of May 31, 2018.  

7.      COMMITMENTS
                                         AND CONTINGENCIES     

The
Company neither owns nor leases any real or personal property. An officer has provided offices without charge. There is no obligation
for the officer to continue this arrangement. Such costs are immaterial to the financial statements and accordingly are not reflected
herein. The officers and directors are involved in other business activities and most likely will become involved in other business
activities in the future.  

8.      SUBSEQUENT
                                         EVENTS     

In
accordance with SFAS 165 (ASC 855-10) the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to May 31, 2018 through September 12,
2018. There is no subsequent event through September 12, 2018.

9A Controls and Procedures   

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting    

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2018 using the criteria established in  Internal Control - Integrated
Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).  

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
as of May 31, 2018, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described
below.  

1.    We
                                         do not have an Audit Committee   While not being legally obligated to have an audit
                                         committee, it is the management s view that such a committee, including a financial
                                         expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company s financial
                                         statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee,
                                         and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide
                                         the necessary oversight over management s activities.    

2.    We
                                         did not maintain appropriate cash controls   As of May 31, 2018, the Company has
                                         not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process,
                                         including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require
                                         dual signature on the Company s bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor
                                         cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in
                                         their bank accounts.    

3.    We
                                         did not implement appropriate information technology controls   As at May 31, 2018,
                                         the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there
                                         is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company s data or off-site
                                         storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors.    

Accordingly,
the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the
annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Company s internal controls.  

As
a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2018 based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued
by COSO.  

10   

Although
our Company is unable to meet the standards under COSO because of the limited funds available to a company of our size and stage
of development, we are committed to improving our financial organization. As funds become available, we will undertake to: (1)
create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives, (2) increase our personnel resources and technical accounting
expertise within the accounting function (3) appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed
to the audit committee of our Company resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the
establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and (4) prepare and implement sufficient written policies
and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application
of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.  

We
will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over
financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or
improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. However, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of
controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any
design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls
effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2018, that occurred during our fourth fiscal
quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Audit
Committee   

We
do not have an audit committee nor an audit committee financial expert. We do not have an audit committee financial expert because
we believe the cost related to retaining a financial expert at this time is prohibitive. Further, because we have no operations,
at the present time, we believe the services of a financial expert are not warranted.  

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance   

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and officers, and the persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our
common stock, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Copies of all
filed reports are required to be furnished to us pursuant to Rule 16a-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based solely on the
reports received by us and on the representations of the reporting persons, we believe that these persons have complied with all
applicable filing requirements during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018, each of the following persons filed a report that was
late: Mr. Lu, Mr. Ma, Hongxia Li and Chen Yang .
