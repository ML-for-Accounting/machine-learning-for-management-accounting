         Table of Contents              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      For the Six Months Ended August 31, 2018 and 2017         Note 1. Basis of Presentation        The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial information has been prepared by DigitalTown, Inc. (the "Company") in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S.") ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Accordingly, it does not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair statement of this financial information have been included. Financial results for the interim period presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year as a whole or any other interim period. This financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 28, 2018.       The Company s fiscal year end is the last day in February. Our current fiscal year ends on February 28, 2019 and we refer to it as  fiscal 2019 . Last year, our fiscal year ended on February 28, 2018 and we refer to this year as  fiscal 2018 .        Note 2. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies :           Nature of Business              The Company was founded in 1982 under the laws of the State of Minnesota as Command Small Computer Learning Center, Inc., a computer training company and operated under several different names in the computer hardware and training sector. In 2005, the Company began acquiring domain names. On March 1, 2007, the Company changed its name to DigitalTown, Inc. and began developing a business plan to build a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that places people at the heart of Smart Cities. DigitalTown leverages Blockchain to harness the real power of a secure distributed internet in order to deliver a localized commerce platform capable of transacting in a multi-currency world. The Company s headquarters are located in Bellevue, WA. The Company s common stock is traded on the OTC Markets under the ticker symbol of DGTW.       The Company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has a working capital deficit, recurring losses, and negative cash flows from operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.        At August 31, 2018, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $53,874,554. The Company anticipates that growth from its operations, expected future proceeds from additional financing through the sale of its common stock or other equity-based securities, and additional sales and/or leases of existing domain names will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure needs through at least February 28, 2019. In the event that the Company is unable to obtain additional capital in the future, the Company would reduce operating expenses or cease operations altogether.          Principles of Consolidation            The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DigitalTown, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared by the Company in United States (U.S.) dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.          Reclassifications               Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated statement of cash flows have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Proceeds from related party notes payable received in the prior period have been reclassified from the prior period classification. These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net income or accumulated deficit for any year.          Use of Estimates            The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.                    F-5        
         Table of Contents               Accounts Receivable            Accounts receivable arise from the software licensing of our Rezserve subsidiary. The Company evaluates collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors including the age of the receivable or a specific customer s inability to meet its financial conditions. In these circumstances, the Company records an allowance to reduce the receivable to an amount it deems collectible. The Company has recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts as of August 31, 2018 and February 28, 2018 of $5,343 and $5,456, respectively.             Goodwill and Intangible Assets            Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets related to completed acquisitions. Goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized but instead tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if necessary.       Intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are comprised of amounts assigned to acquisition-related items, such as trade names, customer lists, non-compete agreements and intellectual property/technology. Intangible assets are considered either definite or indefinite lived assets. Definite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Certain intangible assets may have an indefinite life and are not amortized, but rather evaluated for impairment annually.       We evaluate any goodwill and intangible assets for an impairment on an annual basis each fiscal year end. We also evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the goodwill and intangible assets below the carrying amounts. Based upon our review and analysis, we deemed all of the goodwill and intangible assets acquired in fiscal 2018 as fully impaired. Accordingly, we recognized an impairment expense of $1,721,760.          Revenue Recognition            Effective March 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606   Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue from the commercial sales of products, licensing agreements and contracts to perform pilot studies by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. For the comparative periods, revenue has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 605   Revenue Recognition. Under ASC 605, revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) the performance of service has been rendered to a customer or delivery has occurred; (3) the amount of fee to be paid by a customer is fixed and determinable; and (4) the collectability of the fee is reasonably assured. There was no impact on the Company s financial statements as a result of adopting Topic 606 for the six months ended August 31, 2018 and the twelve months ended February 28, 2018.       The Company recognizes revenue when the following four criteria have been met:                          Persuasive evidence that a business relationship exists                   Delivery has occurred                   The price is fixed and determinable                   Collectibility is reasonably assured            The Company primarily recognizes revenue from sale of software licenses and related development services. Software licensing and development revenue is recognized as invoiced and over the course of the applicable agreements. In the event projects have multiple project milestones, revenue is recognized as milestones are achieved and invoices are submitted for payment.       The Company may also be merchant of record for merchant transactions processed on the DigitalTown platform. When this happens, revenue is recognized on the date of the transaction. The Company has experience in merchant transaction fraud mitigation. To the extent chargebacks become material, the Company will implement a formal practice for allowance for doubtful accounts.                    F-6        
         Table of Contents               Fair Value of Financial Instruments          Under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820-10-5, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The standard outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. Under U.S. GAAP, certain assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value, and FASB ASC 820-10-50 details the disclosures that are required for items measured at fair value.       As of August 31, 2018 and February 28, 2018, the Company does not have any financial instruments that must be measured under the fair value standard. The Company s financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are as follows:       Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.       Level 2 - Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).       Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company s assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.       There were no transfers of financial assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 inputs during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 or the fiscal year 2018.          Cash Equivalents            The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of August 31, 2018 and February 28, 2018, the Company had no cash equivalents.          Cash Deposits in Excess of Federally Insured Limits            The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company and currently have insurance coverage up to $250,000. At August 31, 2018 and February 28, 2018, the Company did not have any deposit accounts in excess of federally insured limits.           Prepaid Domain Names             The annual domain name renewal fees are currently capitalized in the period of renewal then amortized over one year. Only the purchase of new domain names is capitalized. See Note 5 for further information.          Property and Equipment             Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life or the term of the related lease. The Company recorded $3,885 and $2,086 of depreciation expense for the first six months of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred; major renewals and improvements are capitalized. As items of property or equipment are sold or retired, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operating income. See Note 4 for further information.                        F-7        
         Table of Contents               Income Taxes              Deferred tax assets (net of any valuation allowance) and liabilities resulting from temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards are recorded using an asset-and-liability method. Deferred taxes relating to temporary differences and loss carryforwards are measured using the tax rate expected to be in effect when they are reversed or are realized. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be ultimately realized. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty of realizing the related future benefits.       The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB guidance. This guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company believes its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained upon examination and, accordingly, no reserves or related accruals for interest and penalties have been recorded at August 31, 2018 or February 28, 2018. In accordance with the FASB guidance, the Company has adopted a policy under which, if required to be recognized in the future, interest related to the underpayment of income taxes will be classified as a component of interest expense and any related penalties will be classified in operating expenses in the statements of operations. The Company has three open years of tax returns subject to examination.          Stock-Based Compensation, Including Options and Warrants            Use of equity for compensation is a material part of the Company s near-term strategy. The Company recognizes the cost of stock-based compensation plans and awards in operations on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period of the awards. The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees, directors, consultants and advisors. The compensation expense for the Company's stock-based payments is based on estimated fair values at the time of the grant.       The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This option pricing model involves a number of assumptions, including the expected lives of stock options, the volatility of the public market price for the Company's common stock and interest rates. Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest.          Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements            In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Accounting Standards Codification 606 ( ASC 606 )). ASU No. 2014-09 provides guidance for revenue recognition. The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract and estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price attributable to each separate performance obligation. Subsequent to the initial standards, the FASB has also issued several ASUs to clarify specific revenue recognition topics. This guidance will be effective for the Company for its fiscal year 2019.      The Company will adopt using the modified retrospective approach to initially apply the update and recognize the remaining contract value at the date of application. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-09 to have any impact on its total cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities.       In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which removes the second step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04, an entity will apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 does not amend the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company has not elected early adoption of this standard and is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2017-04 and cannot currently estimate the financial statement impact of adoption.     In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.  The amendments in this update provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The guidance will be effective for the Company for its fiscal year 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect this ASU to materially impact the Company s consolidated financial statements.                   F-8        
         Table of Contents            In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . Under this guidance, an entity is required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. This guidance offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback transactions. Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of the financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.       The Company believes there are no other new pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.        Note 3. Going Concern         The Company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has a working capital deficit, recurring losses, and negative cash flows from operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.        At August 31, 2018, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $53,874,554. The Company anticipates growth from its operations, expected future proceeds from additional financing through the sale of its common stock or other equity-based securities, and additional sales and/or leases of existing domain names will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure needs through at least August 31, 2018. In the event that the Company is unable to obtain additional capital in the future, the Company would further reduce expenses or cease operations altogether.        Note 4. Property and Equipment        Property and equipment are as follows:               Depreciation expense for the first six months of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was $3,885 and $2,086, respectively.         Note 5. Prepaid Domain Names        During the first six months of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred $30,656 and $19,001, respectively, of annual domain name renewal fees, specifically related to .CITY registrations. These amounts were recorded as prepaid domain name renewal fees, and are then amortized over one year on a straight-line basis. During the first six months of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized $45,676 and $74,938 of expense as cost of revenues related to this amortization. As of August 31, 2018, and February 28, 2018, the Company has $33,243 and $77,977, respectively, of remaining prepaid domain name renewal fees recorded on the balance sheet. See Note 9 for information on Related Party activity within Prepaid Domain Names.         Note 6. Accrued Expenses and Deferred Revenue          Accrued Expenses         On December 5, 2016, Richard Pomije filed a lawsuit against the Company. Mr. Pomije asserts an employment agreement existed and a continuing obligation of the Company in the form of a monthly salary for a 1 year term from May 18, 2015 to May 17, 2016 was due in addition to a stock subscription receivable. Mr. Pomije claims the Company owes him $260,900, which had been fully accrued for by the Company at February 28, 2017.        On April 18, 2018, Mr. Richard Pomije was granted a judgement for the lawsuit he filed against the Company on December 5, 2016. Mr. Pomije was awarded $256,488 as damages, and $296,488 as attorney s fees and costs, for a total award of $552,976. As at February 28, 2018, $552,976 had been accrued as payable to Mr. Pomije. During the quarter ending August 31, 2018, $10,910 was paid to Mr. Richard Pomije. As at August 31, 2018, $542,066 has been accrued as payable to Mr. Pomije. The Company has filed an appeal. See Note 16 for additional information about transactions between the Company and its former officer.                     F-9        
         Table of Contents            During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, Robert Monster deferred his salary payments to assist with cash conservation. As at August 31, 2018, $70,000 has been accrued as payable to Robert Monster.         Deferred Revenue         During fiscal 2017, the Company signed three customer agreements to perform digital support and construction services for three third party companies.

The fair value of the Company s stock options have been estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model, which requires assumptions as to expected dividends, the options expected life, volatility and risk-free interest rate at the time of the grant. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting periods in the Company s consolidated statements of operations.       On June 1, 2018, the Company issued 3,555,212 stock options with a fair value of $436,131 to one employee to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at a price of $0.10. 3,000,000 options vest immediately and are exercisable for five years. 555,212 options vest over 12 months, and are exercisable for five years.

Note 10. Income Taxes        The Company accounts for income taxes under standards issued by the FASB. Under those standards, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax benefits or consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided for significant deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized through future operations.       No provision for federal income taxes has been recorded due to the net operating loss carry forwards totaling $19,091,224 as of August 31, 2018 that will offset future taxable income. The available net operating loss carry forwards will expire in various years through 2037. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these consolidated financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the future tax loss carry forwards.                The actual income tax provisions differ from the expected amounts calculated by applying the statutory income tax rate to the Company s loss before income taxes. The components of these differences are as follows at August 31, 2018 and February 28, 2018:               Note 11.

Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding.       Due to the recent net losses generated by the Company, there are no dilutive elements. Therefore, basic and diluted EPS are the same.        The following tables provide a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used in calculating basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the second quarter of fiscal years 2019 and 2018:         __________                    Note 13.

GENERAL        DigitalTown, Inc. ( The Company ,  We ,  Us ,  Our  and  DigitalTown ) operates at the intersection of FinTech, Smart Cities and Blockchain by providing a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that places people at the heart of Smart Cities. DigitalTown leverages Blockchain to harness the real power of a secure distributed internet in order to deliver a localized commerce platform capable of transacting in a multi-currency world.        The Company s fiscal year end is the last day in February. Our current fiscal year ends on February 28, 2019 and we refer to it as  fiscal 2019 . Last year, our fiscal year ended on February 28, 2018 and we refer to this year as  fiscal 2018 .        An Overview of DigitalTown        The DigitalTown platform enables local communities to benefit from the digital transformation revolution in three key ways.        First, our platform provides businesses with an opportunity to market themselves affordably and efficiently, locally and globally. We adopt a  local first  approach, meaning local independent business are given preference in search results. Merchants receive a free listing inside the DigitalTown platform. Search will help residents and visitors find the right business based on keywords a business adds to its profile. Local merchants can market to local consumers in a very targeted manner via the DigitalTown App. DigitalTown will provide valuable market data to local merchants enabling them to develop greater customer intimacy. The DigitalTown APIs encourage local innovators to develop solutions that help businesses become more efficient and allow them to compete more effectively in a global marketplace.        Second, the DigitalTown SmartWallet is available to everyone free of charge. The SmartWallet currently supports 16 fiat currencies and will soon support the major Cryptocurrencies Peer-to-peer transactions are free and C2B transactions incur a 1% payment processing fee. The DigitalTown SmartWallet and our Self Sovereign Identity technology can ensure that each user is known and verified, enabling a higher degree of trust to be established within the platform than is possible with traditional user accounts.       Third, the DigitalTown Community Tools provide a decentralized social platform where residents and visitors, or fans of a particular city, can connect, share, create and manage projects and events, start and join discussions, vote on matters of local interest and fundraise. With DigitalTown the good cause retains 100% of the funds raised. Community engagement is rewarded with blockchain-based Community Points, which hold no monetary value, but can be redeemed with participating merchants who in turn can use them to market direct to customers.                    3        
         Table of Contents             The Strategic Importance of Local Online Economic Development        The DigitalTown platform elevates local communities to an advanced state of technical capability. To date, most cities have historically taken a hands-off approach towards the Internet. However, we believe that in the future city management will further consider the Internet as an integral part of their strategic plan for economic growth.       The continued expansion of big box retailers and steep growth of national eCommerce has created an increased number of challenges for locally owned small businesses. This requires a new approach to online economic development   one that equips local merchants with the means to compete locally and sell nationally. DigitalTown provides a cost-effective solution to help local businesses compete against entities with greater reach, scale and resources.        Why the DigitalTown Solution Makes Sense        The DigitalTown platform is a cost-effective solution for enabling a community to become a smart community, which we define as connected to shared content and local commerce. A key enabler for this capability is the continued growth of smartphones that are powered by common frameworks, such as Apple iOS and Android. The use of smartphones has enabled individuals to communicate and transact in real-time anywhere they choose using their smartphone, which serves as a proxy for identity, reputation, preferences and method of payment. In effect, the smartphone has become the digital wallet. We believe the opportunity is global and our approach, which supports public-private partnerships, will, in the future, enable accelerated adoption particularly in rural communities where trust of technology is lower, the need is potentially greater, and economic models are at the greatest risk.        Intellectual Property        Software: The Company has developed a proprietary platform for enabling any community to become a smart community, incorporating advanced features for economic development, community engagement and digital inclusion. In addition, the Company has completed acquisitions of 5 software companies: Cloud.Market, Software Masters, Inc, Rezserve Technologies Ltd, Appointment.com, and Comencia, Inc., each of which brought significant intellectual property and is in process of being fully integrated into the DigitalTown platform. The Company continues to invest in software with an emphasis on capital efficiency and return on investment.        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 AND 2017      During second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company recorded revenues of $98,547 and cost of revenues of $213,519 for a gross loss of $114,972 compared to revenues of $93,906 and cost of revenues of $89,385 for a gross profit of $4,521 during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. For the second quarter of fiscal 2019, revenues mainly consisted of development fees related to our SmartCity platform, and activities from our Rezserve and Comencia subsidiaries. Cost of revenues consisted of amortization of prepaid annual domain name renewal fees of $0 and $48,531, development expense of $211,608 and $50,077, and merchant processing fees of $1,911 and $1,666, for the fiscal second quarters 2019 and 2018, respectively.      The Company s operating expenses are currently all related to selling, general and administrative activity. These expenses were $1,563,285 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $2,163,757 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, a decrease of $600,472. Our stock-based compensation expense was $639,496 for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to $448,041 for fiscal 2018, an increase of $191,455. We incurred a non-cash expense of $790,059 related to an acquisition we completed in July 2017, which reflected the sum of the cost basis of the liabilities assumed and stock value we used to pay for the acquisition. In addition to the net increase of our non-cash items, our decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was also due to a decrease in employee compensation and benefits of $344,166, a decrease of $60,614 in contractor services, a decrease in legal fees of $40,439, and a decrease in domain name renewal fees of $302,989.      The Company s overall net loss for the current second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased by $489,755 to $2,732,516, as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase was mainly due to losses on debt settlement of $48,037, losses related to cryptocurrencies of $925,817, offset by the decrease in general and administrative items as detailed above.                   4        
         Table of Contents             SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 AND 2017      During the first six months of fiscal 2019, the Company recorded revenues of $184,765 and cost of revenues of $738,847 for a gross loss of $554,082 compared to revenues of $174,177 and cost of revenues of $187,993 for a gross loss of $13,816 during the first six months of fiscal 2018. For the first six months of fiscal 2019, revenues mainly consisted of development fees related to our SmartCity platform, and activities from our Rezserve and Comencia subsidiaries. Cost of revenues consisted of amortization of prepaid annual domain name renewal fees of $302,989 and $26,407, development expense of $434,216 and $113,055, and merchant processing fees of $2,657 and $2,371, for the first six months of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.    The Company s operating expenses are currently all related to selling, general and administrative activity. These expenses were $2,786,903 in the first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to $3,236,944 in the first six months of fiscal 2018, a decrease of $450,041. Our stock-based compensation expense increased by $412,569 to $1,118,367 for the first six months of fiscal 2019, as compared to $705,798 for the first six months of fiscal 2018. We incurred a non-cash expense of $790,059 related to an acquisition we completed in July 2017, which reflected the sum of the cost basis of the liabilities assumed and stock value we used to pay for the acquisition. In addition to the increase of our non-cash items, our net decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was due to a decrease in professional fees of $610,556, and a decrease of $114,639 in travel and conference related costs.       The Company s overall net loss for the first six months of fiscal 2019 increased by $1,644,649 to $4,988,658, as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2018. The increase was mainly due to the increase in other expenses such as interest expense (includes debt discount amortization on various notes payable) of $652,540, loss on debt settlement of $48,037, and losses related to cryptocurrencies of $925,817.        LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      The Company s cash position at August 31, 2018 was $31,942, a decrease of $26,770 from $58,712 at February 28, 2018. During the first six months of fiscal 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $1,540,094 compared to net cash used of $1,567,172 for the first six months of fiscal 2018. When comparing the two periods, the decrease in net cash used in operating activities of $27,078 for the first six months of fiscal 2019 is primarily due to a decrease of cash operating expenses.      Net cash provided by investing activities was $718,181 and cash used was $14,169 for first six months of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company received cash from the sale of cryptocurrencies.       Net cash provided by financing activities for the first six months of fiscal 2019, was $796,359 which consisted of proceeds from the sale of common stock, issuance of convertible loans, and payments on convertible debt. For the first six months of fiscal 2018, the Company received net cash provided by financing activities of $1,125,000, which consisted of proceeds from the sale of common stock, issuance of convertible loans, and borrowings from various promissory notes.       Monthly cash operating expenses for the first six months of 2018, were approximately $350,000 per month. Based on current projections, the Company s monthly cash operating expenses going forward should be approximately $300,000 per month. In the period from September 1, 2018 through October 15, 2018, the Company entered into 1 stock purchase agreement in the amount of $160,358 in exchange for 3,207,160 shares of the Company s restricted common stock. The Company also entered into 1 stock purchase agreement, pursuant to the terms and conditions of our Prospectus dated September 18, 2018, for 1,600,000 shares of the Company s registered common stock.      We believe our current cash reserves and the amounts we expect from future proceeds from the issuance of our common stock should be sufficient to enable us to operate for the next 12 months. In the event that we are unable to operate profitably or raise additional capital through the sale of our common stock on acceptable terms, we would be forced to further reduce operating expenses or cease operations altogether.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements        We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.        Critical Accounting Policies         The discussion and analysis of DigitalTown, Inc. s financial condition and results of operations are based on our audited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management reviews its estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While DigitalTown Inc. s significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to its financial statements, management believes the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:                    5        
         Table of Contents             Prepaid Domain Names    The annual domain name renewal fees are currently amortized over one year and the purchase of any new domain names are the only amounts capitalized. See Note 5 for further information.        Stock-Based Compensation     The Company recognizes the cost of stock-based compensation plans and awards in operations on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period of the awards. The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees, directors, consultants and advisors. The compensation expense for the Company's stock-based payments is based on estimated fair values at the time of the grant.       The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This option pricing model involves a number of assumptions, including the expected lives of stock options, the volatility of the public market price for the Company's common stock and interest rates. Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest.        Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements        Information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data  in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.          ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.         The Company has entered into stock purchase agreements with investors, and has accepted digital currencies as a form of payment from these investors, in exchange for shares of the Company s common stock. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to digital currencies is the volatility in trading prices from day to day, which would only impact the gain/loss recognized at time of exchange on such instruments. As of August 31, 2018, the Company did not hold any digital currencies.       The Company has not entered into, and does not expect to enter into, financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes. The Company does not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swap and/or similar instruments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would only impact interest income earned on such instruments. As of August 31, 2018, the Company did not have any material currency exchange or interest rate risk exposure.          ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.          Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures         Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of August 31, 2018, of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ). The purpose of this evaluation was to determine whether as of the evaluation date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on their evaluation, our management has concluded, as discussed below, that material weaknesses existed in our internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2018 and as a result, our disclosures controls and procedures were not effective. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses that existed as of August 31, 2018, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer has concluded that the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material aspects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).        Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting        Management continues to evaluate the Company's internal controls over financial reporting to ensure that the design and implementation of corrective procedures are adequate to remediate the previously identified material weaknesses from our Form 10-K at February 28, 2018. Due to the small number of employees dealing with general administrative and financial matters and the expenses associated with increases to remediate the disclosure controls and procedures that have been identified, the Company continued to operate without changes to its internal controls over financial reporting for the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q while continuing to evaluate and improve to remediate the material weaknesses at an appropriate cost benefit basis.       During the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2018, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.                    6

Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
