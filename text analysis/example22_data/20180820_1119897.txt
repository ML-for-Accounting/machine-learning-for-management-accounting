NOTE
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of PCT LTD ( the Company ) have been prepared in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
10-Q and reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of our balance sheet,
statements of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  The
results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year.    

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial
statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s December 31,
2017 audited financial statements as reported in its Form 10-K, filed April 17, 2018.  

     Nature
of Operations     

  PCT
LTD (formerly Bingham Canyon Corporation), (the  Company,   PCT Ltd,  or  Bingham ), a Delaware
corporation, was formed on August 27, 1986. The Company changed its domicile to Nevada on August 26, 1999.  

On
August 31, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement with Paradigm Convergence Technologies Corporation ( Paradigm, 
 PCT Corp,  or PCT Corp., the wholly-owned operating subsidiary ) to affect the acquisition of Paradigm as a
wholly-owned subsidiary. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company issued 16,790,625 restricted common shares of Company stock
to all of the shareholders of Paradigm in exchange for all 22,387,500 outstanding Paradigm common stock. In addition, the Company
issued options exercisable into 2,040,000 shares of the Company s common stock (with exercise prices ranging between $0.133
and $0.333) in exchange for 2,720,000 outstanding Paradigm stock options (with exercise prices ranging between $0.10 and $0.25).
These 2,040,000 options have been adjusted at the same exchange rate of 75% that the outstanding common shares were exchanged.
As a result of this reverse recapitalization, PCT Corp, the operating company, is considered the accounting acquirer.  

PCT
Corp. is located in Little River, SC and was formed June 6, 2012 under the name of EUR-ECA, Ltd. On September 11, 2015, its Board
of Directors authorized EUR-ECA Ltd. to file with the Nevada Secretary of State to change its names to Paradigm Convergence Technologies
Corp. PCT Corp. is a technology licensing, OEM and sales/leasing company specializing in environmentally-responsible solutions
for global sustainability. PCT LTD, the public company and  parent  of PCT Corp. holds a United States Patent No.
9,679,170 B2 with a recently granted Canadian Allowance, as well as owning future and pending international patent(s) (response
to examiners comments in process), intellectual property and/or distribution rights to innovative products and technologies. PCT
Corp. provides innovative products and technologies for eliminating bacterial contamination in healthcare facilities, the agricultural
market and in the oil   gas industry. PCT Corp. s overall strategy is to design, assemble, market, sell and/or lease
equipment, fluids and proprietary  certifications  of its products and technologies. PCT Corp., utilizes equipment
leasing program ( System Service Agreements ), joint ventures, licensing, distributor agreements and partnerships.  

  Effective
on March 23, 2018, the Company changed its name from Bingham Canyon Corporation to PCT LTD to more accurately identify the Company s
direction and to develop the complimentary relationship and association with its wholly-owned operating company, PCT Corp.  

     Principles
of Consolidations     

  The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PCT LTD ( Parent ) and PCT Corp. All intercompany
accounts have been eliminated upon consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates     

  The
preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as
well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates are based on historical experience
and on various other market-specific and other relevant assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents     

  Cash
and cash equivalents are considered to be cash and a highly liquid security with original maturities of three months or less.
There was cash of $53 and $7,838 as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. There were no cash equivalents as of
June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.   

     Accounts
Receivable     

  Accounts
receivable are recorded at the time product is shipped or services are provided, including any shipping and handling fees. The
Company provided allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable equal to the estimated collection losses that will be incurred
in collection of all receivables. Accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit history
with customers and their current financial condition. That Company s management determines which accounts are past due and
if deemed uncollectible, the Company charges off the receivable in the period the determination is made. Based on management s
evaluation, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $12,000 at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.  

     Inventory     

  Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We record the value
of our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and
the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand, future pricing and market conditions. As of June 30, 2018
and December 31, 2017, the inventory consisted of parts for equipment sold as replacement parts to existing customers or sold
to new customers. The Company has recorded a reserve allowance of $0 at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.  

     Property
and Equipment     

  Property
and equipment are stated at purchased cost and depreciated utilizing a straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging
from 3 to 7 years after the asset has been placed in service. Upon selling equipment that had been under a lease agreement, the
Company discontinues the depreciation on that piece of equipment, as it transfers ownership to another entity. Additions and major
improvements that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations
as incurred. Upon trade-in, sale or retirement of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed
from the accounts and any related gains or losses are recorded in the results of operations. Accumulated depreciation for period
ending June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were $59,671 and $46,725, respectively.  

Fair
Value Measurements     

  The
Company follows ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,   which defines fair value as the exchange
price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques
used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. A fair value
hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable,
is used to measure fair value:  

Level
    1:  
      Valuations
    for assets and liabilities traded in active markets from readily available pricing sources such as quoted prices in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level
    2:  
      Observable
    inputs (other than Level 1 quoted prices) such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted
    prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable
    or can be corroborated by observable market data.   

Level
    3:  
      Unobservable
    inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets
    or liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques.   

The
carrying values of our financial instruments, including, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses,
accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of these financial instruments.
We do not have other financial assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2018
and December 31, 2017.  

Valuation
of Long-lived Assets     

  The
carrying values of the Company s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable. When projections indicate that the carrying value of the long-lived asset
is not recoverable, the carrying value is reduced by the estimated excess of the carrying value over the projected undiscounted
cash flows. Under similar analysis no impairment was recorded as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Impairment tests are
conducted on an annual basis and, should they indicate a carrying value in excess of fair value, additional impairment changes
may be required.   

Intangible
Assets     

  Costs
to obtain or develop patents are capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the patents, and technology rights are amortized
over estimated useful lives. The Company currently has the right to a U.S. patent (with international patents in process) and
proprietary property technology. Patents and technology are amortized from the date the Company acquires or is awarded the patent
or technology right, over their estimated useful lives, which range from 1 to 15 years. An impairment charge is recognized if
the carrying amount is not recoverable and the carrying These assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization. An impairment
charge is recognized and the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible assets as determined by the projected discounted
net future cash flows. The recorded impairment expense of nil for the periods ending June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Accumulated
amortization was $534,294 and $380,382 as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.  

Research
and Development     

  Research
and development costs are recognized as an expense during the period incurred, which is until the conceptual formulation, design,
and testing of the process is completed and the process has been determined to be commercially viable.  

Revenue
Recognition     

  In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customer (Topic 606) . The new revenue recognition
standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principal is
that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflect
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  

The
Company has structured its revenue as: 1) product (sales or equipment and/or fluid solutions); 2) licensing (contract-based use
of the Company s US EPA Product Registration, returning revenue in licensing fees and/or royalties from minimum or actual
fluid sales); and 3) equipment leases (under systems service agreements, usually 3-year contract for the provision of the Company s
equipment and service of such, under contract to customers, with renewable terms). Revenue from contracts to license technology
to others is immediately recognized since it is a non-refundable deposit.  

Reclassifications     

  Certain
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current presentation.  

Basic
and Diluted Loss per Share     

  Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive potential
common shares outstanding during the period. As of June 30, 2018 there were outstanding common share equivalents (options and
convertible notes payable) which amounted to 1,874,746 shares of common stock. These common share equivalents were not included
in the computation of diluted loss per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements     

  The
Company has reviewed all other FASB and ASU accounting pronouncements and interpretation thereof that have effective dates during
the period reported and in future periods. The company has carefully considered the new pronouncement that alter the previous
GAAP and do not believe than any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the Company s reported financial
position or operations in the near term.  

NOTE
2. GOING CONCERN   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue
as a going concern. The Company has limited assets, has incurred losses since inception of $7,943,881 and has negative cash flows
from operations. As of June 30, 2018, the Company had working capital of $114,172. The Company has relied on raising debt and
equity capital in order to fund its ongoing day-to-day operations and its corporate overhead. The Company will require additional
working capital from either cash flow from operations, from debt or equity financing, or from a combination of these sources.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a period of one year
from the issuance of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty.  

NOTE
3. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   

Depreciation
is computed using the straight-line method and is recognized over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment, which
ranges from 3 to 7 years once placed into service. Depreciation expense does not begin until documentation or equipment placed
in service is provided. Machinery and leased equipment is not intended to be sold to the customer at the end of the lease term.
Depreciation expense was $12,946 and $8,289 for the six months and $7,294 and $4,239 for the three months ended June 30, 2018
and 2017, respectively.  

Property
and Equipment consisted of the following as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017:  

NOTE
4. INTANGIBLE ASSETS   

Amortization
is computed using the straight-line method and is recognized over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets, which ranges
from 1 to 15 years. Amortization expense was $153,912 and $111,230 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  

The
components of intangible assets at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were as follows:  

NOTE
5. Debt   

The
following table summarizes notes payable as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017:  

(b)    On
                                         May 29, 2018, the Company entered into a Guarantee Agreement with a non-related party.
                                         The Company owed an unrelated party $27,500 that was due on October 10, 2017. In consideration
                                         for increasing the principal amount of the loan to $30,000 and a personal guarantee by
                                         the Company s CEO, the lender agreed to extend the maturity date of the loan to
                                         June 30, 2018. The Company evaluated the modification pursuant to ASC 470-60 Troubled
                                         Debt Restructuring by Debtors, and ASC 470-50 Modification and Extinguishment. The Company
                                         concluded that the Company is experiencing financial difficulty and that a concession
                                         was not granted. As the creditors have not granted a concession the guidance contained
                                         in ASC 470-60 does not apply. As the original and new debt instruments are not considered
                                         substantially different, extinguishment accounting does not apply, and the Company accounted
                                         for the revised note as a debt modification. The carrying amount of the payable was not
                                         adjusted and the effects of the changes are reflected in future periods by computing
                                         the constant effective interest rate and applying it to the carrying amount of the payable
                                         each period until maturity.    

(e)    On June 20, 2018, the Company had the following notes, to a non-related party, outstanding:   

On
June 20, 2018, the Company issued a new note that consolidated into one the notes above as well as any outstanding interest owed.
The new note has a principal of $130,000, bears interest at 8% per annum and is due on January 2, 2020. As the debt is being exchanged
with the lender, the Company evaluated the modification pursuant to ASC 470-60  Troubled Debt Restructuring by Debtors ,
and ASC 470-50  Modification and Extinguishment .   

The
indicators of financial difficulty contained in ASC 470-60 were reviewed and it was concluded that the Company is experiencing
financial difficulty. The Company then determined that a concession was granted. As the creditors have granted a concession the
troubled debt restructuring model contained in ASC 470-60 was applied. The carrying amount of the payable was not adjusted and
the effects of the changes are reflected in future periods by computing the constant effective interest rate and applying it to
the carrying amount of the payable each period until maturity.   

(f)    On June 20, 2018, the Company had the following notes, to a non-related party, outstanding:   

On
June 20, 2018, the Company issued a new note that consolidated into one note the notes above as well as any outstanding interest
owed. The new note has a principal of $126,964, bears interest at 6% per annum. The Company must repay $66,964 of the note on
August 31, 2018, and the remaining $60,000 on January 2, 2020. If the Company fails to make the $66,664 on August 31, 2018 the
entire amount owed under the original notes becomes due immediately. As the debt is being exchanged with the lender, the Company
evaluated the modification pursuant to ASC 470-60 Troubled Debt Restructuring by Debtors, and ASC 470-50 Modification and Extinguishment.   

The
indicators of financial difficulty contained in ASC 470-60 were reviewed and it was concluded that the Company is experiencing
financial difficulty as there is significant doubt that the Company is a going concern and that there is no assurance that the
Company will have sufficient cash flows to service the debt through its maturity. The Company then proceeded to assess whether
the creditors granted a concession. The Company determined that a concession was granted as the effective borrowing rate on the
restructured debt is lower than the effective borrowing rate of the old debt. As the creditors have granted a concession the troubled
debt restructuring model contained in ASC 470-60 was applied. The carrying amount of the payable was not adjusted and the effects
of the changes are reflected in future periods by computing the constant effective interest rate and applying it to the carrying
amount of the payable each period until maturity.   

The
following table summarizes notes payable, related parties as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017:  

(i)    On
                                         June 20, 2018, the Company had the following notes to an employee and Director of the
                                         Company outstanding:    

On
June 20, 2018, the Company issued a new note that consolidated into one note the notes above as well as any outstanding interest
owed. The new note has a principal of $380,000, bears interest at 8% per annum and is due on January 2, 2020. As the debt is being
exchanged with the lender, the Company evaluated the modification pursuant to ASC 470-60 Troubled Debt Restructuring by Debtors,
and ASC 470-50 Modification and Extinguishment.   

The
indicators of financial difficulty contained in ASC 470-60 were reviewed and it was concluded that the Company is experiencing
financial difficulty and that a concession was granted. As the creditor granted a concession the troubled debt restructuring model
contained in ASC 470-60 was applied. The carrying amount of the payable was not adjusted and the effects of the changes are reflected
in future periods by computing the constant effective interest rate and applying it to the carrying amount of the payable each
period until maturity.   

(j)    On
                                         June 20, 2018, the Company had the following notes to the Chairman and CEO of the Company
                                         outstanding:    

On
June 20, 2018, the Company issued a new note that consolidated into one note the notes above as well as any outstanding interest
owed. The new note has a principal of $350,000, bears interest at 5% per annum and is due on January 2, 2020. The Company evaluated
the transaction under the guidance found in ASC 470-50 Modification and Extinguishment.   

The
Company concluded that the Company is experiencing financial difficulty and that a concession was not granted. As the creditor
has not granted a concession, the guidance contained in ASC 470-60 was applied. The Company accounted for the new note as a debt
modification. The carrying amount of the payable was not adjusted and a new effective interest rate was determined on the modification
date that equates the revised cash flows to the carrying amount of the original debt.

                                         June 20, 2018, the Company had a $15,000 note to the CEO of the Company s spouse
                                         outstanding. On June 20, 2018, the Company issued a new note that consolidated the note
                                         above as well as any outstanding interest owed. The new note has a principal of $17,000,
                                         bears interest at 5% per annum and is due on January 2, 2020. The Company evaluated the
                                         transaction under the guidance found in ASC 470-50 Modification and Extinguishment.

following table summarizes convertible notes payable as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017:  

(m)    On
                                         June 5, 2018, the Company entered into a convertible promissory with an unrelated party
                                         for $68,000. The note is due on June 5, 2019 and bears interest on the unpaid principal
                                         balance at a rate of 12% per annum. Stringent pre-payment terms apply (from 12% to 17%
                                         to 22% to 27% to 32% to 37%, dependent upon the timeframe of repayment during the note s
                                         term) and any part of the notice which is not paid when due shall bear interest at the
                                         rate of 22.0% per annum from the due date until paid. The Company must, at all times,
                                         reserve six times that number of shares that would be issuable upon full conversion of
                                         the note, with an initial reserved share amount of 1,592,506 shares. The Note may be
                                         converted by the Lender at any time after 180 days of the date of issuance into shares
                                         of Company s common stock at a conversion price equal to 61% of the average 3 lowest
                                         trading prices during the 15 trading day period prior to the conversion date. Due to
                                         this provision, the Company considered whether the embedded conversion option qualifies
                                         for derivative accounting under ASC 815-15 Derivatives and Hedging. As the note isn t
                                         convertible until 180 days following issuance, no derivative liability was recognized
                                         as of June 30, 2018

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Executive
Overview    

On
August 31, 2016, PCT LTD entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) with Paradigm Convergence
Technologies Corporation, a Nevada corporation ( Paradigm ). Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, Paradigm
became the wholly-owned subsidiary of PCT LTD after the exchange transaction. PCT LTD is a holding company, which through Paradigm
is engaged in the business of marketing new products and technologies through licensing and joint ventures.  

PCT
LTD had not recorded revenues for the two fiscal years prior to its acquisition of Paradigm and was dependent upon financing to
continue basic operations. Paradigm has recorded revenue since it initiated operations in 2012; however, those revenues have not
been sufficient to finance operations. The Company recorded a net loss of $668,059 for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and
$1,199,361 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and accumulated losses of $7,943,881 from inception through June 30, 2018.  

PCT
LTD remains dependent upon additional financing to continue operations. The Company intends to raise additional financing through
private placements of its common stock and note payable issuances. We expect that we would issue such stock pursuant to exemptions
to the registration requirements provided by federal and state securities laws. The purchasers and manner of issuance will be
determined according to our financial needs, as discussed below, and the available exemptions to the registration requirements
of the Securities Act of 1933. We also note that if we issue more shares of our common stock, then our stockholders may experience
dilution in the value per share of their common stock.  

The
expected costs for the next twelve months include:  

continuation of
    commercial launch of non-toxic sanitizing, disinfecting and sterilizing products and technologies with a strong emphasis on
    health care facilities, including hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, clinics and medical, dental and veterinarian
    offices;   

continued research
    and development on product generation units including those designed for on-site deployment at customers  facilities;   

accelerated research
    and development and initial commercialization on applications of the products in the agricultural sector, most specifically
    with respect to abatement of a specific crop disease crisis caused by a bacterium in the U.S. and elsewhere;   

acquiring available
    complementary and continuations of technology rights (patents);   

payment of short-term
    debt;   

general and administrative
    operating costs.   

Management
projects these costs to total approximately $2,500,000. To minimize these costs, the Company intends to maintain its practice
of controlling operating overheads with efficient facilities commitments, generally below market salaries and consulting fees,
and rigorous prioritization of expenditure requirements. Based on its understanding of the commercial readiness of its products
and technologies, the capabilities of its personnel (current and being hired), established business relationships and the general
market conditions, management believes that the Company expects to be at or close to profitability by the end of the fourth quarter
of 2018.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

A
critical component of our operating plan impacting our continued existence is the ability to obtain additional capital through
additional equity and/or debt financing. We do not anticipate generating sufficient positive internal operating cash flow until
such time as we can deliver our products to market and generate substantial revenues, which may take the next full year to fully
realize, if ever. In the event we cannot obtain the necessary capital to pursue our strategic plan, we may have to significantly
curtail our operations. This would materially impact our ability to continue operations.  

At
June 30, 2018, the Company recorded a net loss of $1,199,361 and working capital of $114,172. We have recorded a relatively small
amount of revenues from operations since inception and we have not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover
our operating costs. During the years ended 2018 and 2017 we have primarily relied upon advances and loans from stockholders and
third parties to fund our operations. The Company has relied on raising debt and equity capital in order to fund its ongoing day-to-day
operations and its corporate overhead. We had $53 in cash at June 30, 2018, compared to $ 7,838 in cash at December 31, 2017.
We had total liabilities of $2,089,720 at June 30, 2018 compared to $1,456,198 at December 31, 2017.  

Our
current cash flow is not sufficient to meet our monthly expenses of approximately $210,000 and to fund future research and development.
We intend to rely on additional debt financing, loans from existing stockholders and private placements of common stock for additional
funding in addition to the increasing our recognized revenue from the leasing and/or sale of products; however, there is no assurance
that additional funding will be available. We do not have material commitments for future capital expenditures. However, we cannot
assure you that we will be able to obtain short-term financing, or that sources of such financing, if any, will continue to be
available, and if available, that they will be on favorable terms.  

During
the next 12 months we anticipate incurring additional costs related to the filing of Exchange Act reports. We believe we will
be able to meet these costs through funds provided by management, significant stockholders and/or third parties. We may also rely
on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash to convert debt or pay for expenses.  

Commitments
and Obligations    

At
June 30, 2018 the Company recorded notes payable and convertible notes payable totaling approximately $1,651,099 (net of debt
discount) compared to notes payable totaling $1,134,217 (net of debt discount) at December 31, 2017. These notes payable represent
cash advances received and expenses paid from third parties and related parties. All of the notes payable carry interest from
0% to 13% and are due ranging from on demand to March 21, 2021.  

The
Company headquarters and operations is located in Little River, South Carolina. The South Carolina lease amounts to $4,800 per
month, expires on November 30, 2019 and includes an option to renew for two additional three-year periods.  

Results
of Operations for the Three Month Periods Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017    

Revenues
increased to $70,072 for the three months ended June 30, 2018 (the  2018 second quarter ) compared to $10,872 for
the three months ended June 30, 2017 (the  2017 second quarter ). The revenue increase for the period was due to the
increase in steady revenue from fluid sales (including monthly minimum royalties), parts sales, license fees and the additional
revenue from recurring leased-equipment income.  

Total
operating expenses increased to $698,487 during the 2018 second quarter compared to $479,412 during the 2017 second quarter. The
increase during the second quarter of 2018 was primarily due to an increase in personnel, salaries, an increase in audit fees,
accounting and commercial market development as well as purchases of components and other increased operating necessities. The
cost of product during this period decreased due to the significantly less expense associated with producing fluids for sale and/or
royalties from the sale of fluids in comparison to the production of equipment. A large portion of this period s revenue
was realized from the sale of fluids and from recurring revenue from equipment placed into service in 2017.  

General
and administrative expenses increased to $613,569 for the 2018 second quarter compared to $327,514 during the 2017 second quarter.
The increase during the second quarter of 2018 was primarily due to an increase in personnel, salaries, insurance, and other overhead
expense.  

Research
and development expenses decreased to $nil for the 2018 second quarter compared to $56,710 during the 2017 second quarter. The
decrease in research and development expense during the second quarter of 2018 was primarily due to the Company developing most
of its technologies around the Hydrolyte  technology in the prior periods.  

Depreciation
and amortization expenses decreased to $80,162 during the 2018 second quarter compared to $87,080 during the 2017 second quarter.
The decrease was primarily due to a slight decrease in the value of certain intangible assets and the amortization associated
with the decrease.  

Total
interest expenses increased to $39,644 during the 2018 second quarter compared to $16,575 during the 2017 second quarter. Total
interest expense increased during the 2018 second quarter due to a greater number and value of loans in effect during the period.  

As a result of the changes described above,
net loss increased to $668,059 during the 2018 second quarter compared to $485,115 during the 2017 second quarter. 

Results of Operations for the Six Month
Periods Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017   

Revenues
increased to $112,231 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $22,229 for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The revenue
increase for the period was due to the increase in steady revenue from fluid sales (including monthly minimum royalties), parts
sales, license fees and the additional revenue from leasing equipment under contract and the recurring leased-equipment income.  

Total
operating expenses increased to $1,246,126 during the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $1,160,252 during the six month
period ended June 30, 2017. The increase for the period was primarily due to an increase in personnel, salaries, an increase in
audit fees, accounting and commercial market development as well as purchases of components and other increased operating necessities.
The cost of product during this period decreased due to the significantly less expense associated with producing fluids for sale
and/or royalties from the sale of fluids in comparison to the production of equipment. A large portion of the period s revenues
during this period were from the sale of fluids and from recurring revenue from equipment placed into service in 2017.  

General
and administrative expenses increased to $1,058,794 during the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $957,579 during the
six month period ended June 30, 2017. The increase during the period was primarily due to an increase in personnel, salaries,
insurance, and other overhead expense.  

Research
and development expenses decreased to $nil for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $69,912 during the six month period
ended June 30, 2017. The decrease in research and development expense during the period was primarily due to the Company developing
most of its technologies around the Annihilyzer  and Hydrolyte  systems in the prior periods.  

Depreciation
and amortization expenses increased to $166,858 during the six month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to $113,424 during the
six month period ended June 30, 2017, The decrease was primarily due to depreciation as a result of placing equipment into service.  

Total
interest expenses increased to $65,448 during the six month period ended June 30, 2018 compared to $28,446 during the six month
period ended June 30, 2017. Total interest expense increased during the 2018 second quarter due to a greater number and value
of loans in effect during the period.  

As
a result of the changes described above, net loss from operations after income taxes increased to $1,199,361 during the six month
period ended June 30, 2018 compared to $1,166,469 during the six month period ended June 30, 2017.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

We
have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.  

Critical
Accounting Policies    

Emerging
Growth Company   - We qualify as an  emerging growth company  under the recently enacted Jumpstart Our Business
Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act ). As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain
disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, among other things, we will not be required to:  

Have an auditor
    report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;   

Submit certain executive
    compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as  say-on-pay  and  say-on-frequency    

Obtain stockholder
    approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved; and   

Disclose certain
    executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons
    of the Chief Executives compensation to median employee compensation.   

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition
period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words,
an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply
to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements
may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.  

We
will remain an  emerging growth company  until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which
our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion; (ii) the fifth anniversary of our first sale of common equity pursuant to an
effective registration statement; (iii) the date that we become a  large accelerated filer  as defined in Rule 12b-2
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates
exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed third fiscal quarter; or (iv) the date on which
we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.  

Recent
Accounting Developments   

The
Company has reviewed all other FASB issued ASU accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effective dates
during the period reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter the previous
GAAP and do not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the Company s reported financial
position or operations in the near term.

Not

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management
to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President, who serves as our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and
Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. The disclosure controls and procedures
ensure that all information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i)
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rule and forms; and (ii) accumulated
and communicated to our President as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation,
our President concluded that as of June 30, 2018, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.    

Notwithstanding
this finding of ineffective disclosure controls and procedures, we concluded that the consolidated financial statements included
in this Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the
periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    

Our
management is responsible to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our principal executive
officer is responsible to design or supervise a process that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The policies and procedures include:  

maintenance
of records in reasonable detail to accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets,  

  provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors, and  

  provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could
have a material effect on our financial statements.  

For
the period ended June 30, 2018, management has relied on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO),  Internal Control - Integrated Framework,  to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. Based upon that framework, our President has determined that our internal control over financial reporting for period
ended June 30, 2018, the year ended December 31, 2017, was not effective.  

The
material weaknesses relate to the limited number of persons responsible for the recording and reporting of financial information,
the lack of separation of financial reporting duties, and the limited size of our management team in general. We are in the process
of evaluating methods of improving our internal control over financial reporting, including the possible addition of financial
reporting staff and the increased separation of financial reporting responsibility, and intend to implement such steps as are
necessary and possible to correct these material weaknesses.  

Our
management determined that there were no changes made in our internal controls over financial reporting during the second quarter
of 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

Internal
control systems, no matter how well designed and operated, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even a system which
is determined to be effective cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected or prevented.  Our
systems of internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation.

On June 12, 2018, the Company entered into
a 6-month service agreement, expiring on December 12, 2018, for business development and the development of financial reports.
Per the terms of the agreement, the consulting company was issued 50,000 shares of restricted stock on June 29, 2018. 

The disclosure set forth below under Item
5 (Other Information) pertaining to the Power Up Notes and Power Up Agreements is incorporated by reference into this Item 2. The
Power Up Notes described in Item 5 below were issued in reliance upon exemptions from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2)
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 506 promulgated thereunder. The Power UP Agreements executed in connection
therewith contains representations to support our reasonable belief that Power Up had access to information concerning our operations
and financial condition, is acquiring the securities for its own account and not with a view to the distribution thereof, and is
an  accredited investor  as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.
At the time of their issuance, the Power Up Notes and any shares of common stock issued upon conversion thereof will be deemed
to be restricted securities for purposes of the Securities Act and the certificates representing the securities shall bear legends
to that effect. We have initially reserved 2,630,757 shares of common stock for issuance under the terms of the Power Up Notes. 

 All of the above-described issuances/grants
were exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) and/or Regulation D of the Securities Act as transactions not involving
a public offering. With respect to each transaction listed above, no general solicitation was made by either the Company or any
person acting on its behalf. All such securities issued pursuant to such exemptions are restricted securities as defined in Rule 144(a)(3)
promulgated under the Securities Act, appropriate legends have been placed on the documents evidencing the securities, and may
not be offered or sold absent registration or pursuant to an exemption therefrom.

5. OTHER INFORMATION   

Power Up Notes  

On June 5, 2018 and July 25, 2018 (each a  Closing
Date ), we completed the sale of two Convertible Promissory Notes (the  Power Up Notes ) in the principal amounts
of $68,000 and $38,000, respectively, with interest rates of 12% per annum pursuant to the terms of two Securities Purchase Agreements
between Power Up Lending Group Ltd. ( Power Up ), a Virginia corporation, and us (the  Power Up Agreements ).
 The Power Up Notes mature on June 5, 2019 and July 25, 2019, respectively (the  Maturity Dates ). We reimbursed
Power Up $5,000 for its legal fees and paid Power Up a $1,000 due diligence fee, resulting in net proceeds to us from the Power
Up Notes of $65,000 and $35,000, respectively. 

The Power Up Notes may be prepaid in whole
or in part, at any time during the period beginning on each Closing Date and ending on the date which is 180 days following the
issue date, beginning at 112% of the outstanding principal and accrued interest increasing by 5% for every 30 day period thereafter
until the 180 th  day following the Closing Date. After the expiration of the 180 days following the Closing Date, we
may not prepay the Note for any reason. 

At any time after 180 days after the date the
Power Up Notes are issued, the Power Up Notes are convertible into our common stock, at Power Up s option, at a 39% discount
to the market price, which is defined as 61% of the average of the lowest three (3) closing bid prices for the our common stock
during the fifteen (15) trading days prior to the conversion date.  The conversion price is subject to proportional adjustment
in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, and similar corporate events. Further, if we fail to deliver shares to Power Up
upon conversion through willful or deliberate hindrance on our part we shall pay to Power Up $2,000 in cash per day as liquidated
damages or, at Power Up s option, such amount being added to the principal amount of the Power Up Notes. 

Power Up has agreed to restrict its ability
to convert the Power Up Notes and receive shares of common stock such that the number of shares of common stock held by them in
the aggregate and their affiliates after such conversion or exercise does not exceed 4.99% of the then issued and outstanding shares
of common stock.  The Power Up Notes are a debt obligation arising other than in the ordinary course of business, which constitutes
a direct financial obligation of us.  The Power Up Notes also provide for penalties and rescission rights if we do not deliver
shares of common stock upon conversion within the required timeframes set forth in the Power Up Agreements. We must, at all times,
reserve six times that number of shares that would be issuable upon full conversion of the Power Up Notes, with an initial reserved
share amount of 1,592,506 and 1,038,251 shares, respectively. 

The Power Up Notes contain default events which,
if triggered and not timely cured (if curable), will result in a default payment equal to 150% the amount owed to Power Up and
a default interest at the rate of 22% per annum. 

The above description of certain material
terms of the Power Up Notes and Power Up Agreements are not a complete description of all terms of the financing transaction and
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Power Up Notes and Power Up Agreements, which are attached hereto as Exhibits
4.1, 4.2, 10.6 and 10.7, respectively.
