NOTE
1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   

MagneGas
Corporation (the  Company ) was organized in the State of Delaware on December 9, 2005.  

The
Company is an alternative energy company that has developed a proprietary plasma arc system ( Plasma Arc Flow Units 
or  Plasma Arc Flow System ) which generates hydrogen based synthetic gases through the gasification of various types
of liquid feedstocks. The Company s synthetic gas   MagneGas2  - is bottled in cylinders and is distributed to
the metalworking market as an alternative cutting fuel to acetylene and propane. Through the course of its business development,
the Company has established a retail and wholesale platform and a network of brokers to sell its MagneGas2  for use in the
metalworking and manufacturing industries throughout the world. Additionally, the Company is in the process of developing ancillary
uses of MagneGas2  for additional end-user applications. The Company s Plasma Arc Flow Units include various commercial
applications, most notably the sterilization of liquid waste, which has resulted in the Company s marketing and sale of
Plasma Arc Flow Units for third-party commercial use.  

In
the second quarter of 2014 the Company began implementing an acquisition-focused growth strategy that was highlighted by the October
2014 purchase of Equipment Sales and Services, Inc. ( ESSI ). ESSI is a full line seller of industrial gases and equipment
for the welding and metal cutting industries. Since acquiring ESSI, the Company has opened four retail locations and distributes
MagneGas2  as a metal cutting fuel as well as other gases and welding supplies. Additional acquisitions and the success of
ESSI has allowed the Company to augment its acquisition growth model with significant organic growth. In January 2018, the Company
acquired all of the assets of GGNG Enterprises, Inc. and began doing business in Southern California under the name  Complete
Welding San Diego . In February 2018, the Company acquired all of the assets of Green Arc Supply, L.L.C. and began doing
business in Texas and Louisiana under the name  Green Arc Supply . On April 3, 2018, the Company acquired all of the
capital stock of Trico Welding Supplies, Inc. and began doing business in Northern California under the name  Trico Welding
Supplies .  

The
Company discusses three major marketing initiatives in this Report. However, operating segments are defined as components of an
enterprise about which separate financial information is available and that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision
maker, or decision making group in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Therefore, even though
the Company discusses discrete initiatives it is actually three product offerings within one operating segment.  

NOTE
2 - GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENTS  PLAN   

As of June 30, 2018, the Company had cash
of $1,147,522 and has reported a net loss of $6,514,500 and has used cash in operations of $3,974,246 for the six
months ended June 30, 2018. In addition, as of June 30, 2018 the Company has working capital of $1,235,578 and an accumulated
deficit of $71,097,370. These conditions indicate that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and
generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of public or private offerings.  

Historically, the Company has financed its
operations through equity and debt financing transactions and expects to continue incurring operating losses for the foreseeable
future. The Company s plans and expectations for the next 12 months include raising additional capital to help fund commercial
operations and product development. The Company utilizes cash in its operations of approximately $660,000 per month. Management
believes, but it cannot be certain, its current holdings of cash, along with the cash to be generated from expected product sales
and future financings, will be sufficient to meet its projected operating requirements for the next twelve months from the date
of this report. 

If
these sources do not provide the capital necessary to fund the Company s operations during the next twelve months from the
date of this Report, the Company may need to curtail certain aspects of its operations or expansion activities, consider the sale
of its assets, or consider other means of financing. The Company can give no assurance that it will be successful in implementing
its business plan and obtaining financing on terms advantageous to the Company or that any such additional financing would be
available to the Company.  

NOTE
3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation    

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and the rules and
regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial information. In the opinion
of the Company s management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting
of normal, recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods ended June
30, 2018 and 2017. As this is an interim period financial statement, certain adjustments are not necessary as with a financial
period of a full year. Although management believes that the disclosures in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
in financial statements that have been prepared in accordance U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the SEC.  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2017, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included
within the Company s Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 16, 2018. The interim results for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ended December 31, 2018 or for any
future interim periods. 

Use
of Estimates    

The
Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These principles require management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management
believes that these estimates are reasonable and have been discussed with the Board of Directors; however, actual results could
differ from those estimates. The consolidated financial statements presented include inventory reserves, fair value of derivative
financial instruments along with other equity instruments, recoverability of deferred tax assets, collections of its receivables,
and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by acquisition.  

Principles
of Consolidation    

The
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the accounting records of MagneGas and its wholly owned subsidiaries
and all material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  

Inventory    

Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Inventory is
comprised of industrial gases, welding supply finished goods and MagneGas2 . The Company carries little to no inventory classified
as work in progress at any time. Estimates of lower of cost or net realizable value are based upon economic conditions, historical
sales quantities and patterns, and in some cases, the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories. The Company
evaluates inventories on a regular basis to identify inventory on hand that may be slow moving. Inventory that is in excess of
current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to the level that approximates its estimate of future demand.  

Goodwill
and Other Indefinite-lived Assets    

The
Company records goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets in connection with business combinations. Goodwill, which represents
the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets of acquired companies, is not amortized.
Indefinite-lived assets are stated at fair value as of the date acquired in a business combination.  

The
Company assesses the recoverability of goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter
and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment
testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) guidance
for goodwill and intangible assets, a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment,
called a component. However, two or more components of an operating segment will be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit
if the components have similar economic characteristics. The Company operates as one reporting unit.  

Authoritative
accounting guidance allows the Company to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the
more detailed two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company performs the quantitative test if its qualitative assessment
determined it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount. The Company may
elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test for any reporting unit or asset. The
quantitative goodwill impairment test, if necessary, is a two-step process. The first step is to identify the existence of a potential
impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit (the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is calculated using a
discounted cash flow model) with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying
amount, the reporting unit s goodwill is considered not to be impaired and performance of the second step of the quantitative
goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. However, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second
step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any.
The second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill
with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair
value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined using
the same approach as employed when determining the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination. That
is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of its assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired
in a business combination and the fair value was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit.  

Revenue
Recognition    

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Principal versus Agent Considerations ,
in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing  and in May 9, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606) , or ASU 2016-12. This update provides clarifying guidance regarding the application of ASU No. 2014-09 - Revenue
From Contracts with Customers which is not yet effective. These new standards provide for a single, principles-based model for
revenue recognition that replaces the existing revenue recognition guidance. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date
of ASU 2014-09 until annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. It has replaced most existing revenue
recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The ASU may be applied retrospectively to historical periods presented or as a cumulative-effect
adjustment as of the date of adoption. We have adopted Topic 606 using a modified retrospective approach and will be applied prospectively
in our financial statements from January 1, 2018 forward. Revenues under Topic 606 are required to be recognized either at a  point
in time  or  over time , depending on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement, and will be evaluated
using a five-step model. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the financial statements, either at initial
implementation nor will it have a material impact on an ongoing basis.  

Based
on the Company s analysis the Company did not identify a cumulative effect adjustment for initially applying the new revenue
standards. The Company principally generates revenue through the sales of: (1) MagneGas2 , other industrial gases and welding
supply goods and (2) Plasma Arc Flow Units, either directly or through one or more of its wholly owned welding supply and gas
distribution subsidiaries. The Company s revenue recognition policy for the year ending December 31, 2018 is as follows:  

Revenue
    for metal-working fuel, industrial gases and welding supplies is recognized at the point where the customer obtains control
    of the goods and we satisfy our performance obligation. The majority of the Company s terms of sale have a single performance
    obligation to transfer products. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue when control has been transferred to the customer,
    generally at the time of shipment of products. Under the previous revenue recognition accounting standard, the Company recognized
    revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, generally upon the delivery of goods.   

Revenue
    generated from sales of a Plasma Arc Flow Unit ( Units ) is no longer recognized on a percentage of completion.
    Even though our Units are cost intensive and generally require a 6 to 9 month production cycle, revenue will now be recognized
    upon shipment of the completed machine. We require purchasers of our Units to make significant payments before we proceed
    with production and at 75% completion; these payments are now classified as customer deposits instead of revenue.    

The
following table summarizes our revenue recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements of operations:  

Information
on Remaining Performance Obligations and Revenue Recognized from Past Performance   

We
do not disclose information about remaining performance obligations pertaining to contracts that have an original expected duration
of one year or less. The transaction price allocated to remaining unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations
with an original expected duration exceeding one year was not material at June 30, 2018.  

Contract
Balances   

The
timing of our revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by our customers. We record a receivable when revenue
is recognized prior to payment and we have an unconditional right to payment. Alternatively, when payment precedes the provision
of the related services, we record deferred revenue until the performance obligations are satisfied.  

Contract
Costs   

Contract
costs include labor and other costs to fulfill contracts associated with our Plasma Arc Flow are capitalized where the revenue
is recognized at a point in time and the costs are determined to be recoverable.  

Preferred
Stock    

The
Company applies the accounting standards for distinguishing liabilities from equity under U.S. GAAP when determining the classification
and measurement of its Preferred stock. Preferred shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as liability instruments
and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable preferred shares (including preferred shares that feature redemption
rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely
within the Company s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, preferred shares are classified as
permanent equity.  

Stock-Based
Compensation    

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation costs under the provisions of ASC 718,  Compensation Stock Compensation ,
which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense related to the fair value of stock-based compensation awards
that are ultimately expected to vest. Stock based compensation expense recognized includes the compensation cost for all stock-based
payments granted to employees, officers, and directors based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions
of ASC 718. ASC 718 is also applied to awards modified, repurchased, or canceled during the periods reported.  

The Company incurred stock-based compensation
charges, net of estimated forfeitures of $105,075 and $0 for the three months ended June 30,2018 and 2017, respectively,
and $123,674 and $0 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and has included such amounts in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.    

Stock-Based
Compensation for Non-Employees    

The
Company accounts for warrants and options issued to non-employees under ASC 505-50, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees, using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The value of such non-employee awards unvested are re-measured over the vesting terms
at each reporting date.  

The
Company incurred stock-based compensation charges, net of estimated forfeitures of $79,125 and $102,905 for the three months ended
June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $142,599 and $243,145 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively,
and has included such amounts in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  

Basic
and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share    

Basic
loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
for each period. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding plus the dilutive effect of shares issuable through the common stock equivalents.  

As
of June 30, 2018, and 2017 the Company s common stock equivalents outstanding are described as follows:  

The
common stock equivalents have not been included in our weighted average shares outstanding calculation in the condensed consolidated
statement of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 as the inclusion would be antidilutive.  

Subsequent
Events    

The
Company evaluates events that have occurred after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. Based
upon the evaluation, the Company did not identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that would have required
adjustment or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements, except as disclosed in Note 14.

NOTE
14 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

Litigation   

Certain
conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the Company,
but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities,
and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings
that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived
merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims, as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected
to be sought therein.  

If
the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s consolidated financial statements. If the
assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable
but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable
and material, would be disclosed.  

Loss
contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed, unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would
be disclosed. There can be no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company s business,
financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.  

On
April 16, 2015, there was an accident at the Company s facilities which occurred during the gas filling process. As a result
of the accident, one employee was killed and one was injured but has recovered and has returned to work. Although the Company
has Workers Compensation Insurance and General Liability Insurance, the financial impact of the accident is unknown at this time.
No customers have terminated their relationship with the Company as a result of the accident. On October 14, 2015 the Company
received their final report from the Occupational and Safety Hazard Administration ( OSHA ) related to the accident.
The OSHA report included findings, many of which were already resolved and a proposed citation. The Company was not cited for
any willful misconduct and no final determination was made as to the cause of the accident. The Company received citations related
to various operational issues and received an initial fine of $52,000. The Company has also been informed by the U.S. Department
of Transportation that it has closed its preliminary investigation with no findings or citations to the Company. The U.S. Department
of Transportation has the right to re-open the investigation should new information become available.  

The
Company is still investigating the cause of the accident and there have been no conclusive findings as of this time. It is unknown
whether the final cause of the accident will be determined and whether those findings will negatively impact Company operations
or sales. The Company continues to be fully operational and transparent with all regulatory agencies. As of June 30, 2018, the
Company has not accrued for any contingency.  

On
November 18, 2016 a lawsuit was filed in District Court in Pinellas County, Florida by the Estate of Michael Sheppard seeking
unspecified damages. The lawsuit alleges that the Company was negligent and grossly negligent in various aspects of its safety,
training and overall work environment that led to the accident. The Company was not cited by OSHA for any willful misconduct nor
did it receive any citations from the Department of Transportation. As of June 30, 2018, the Company has not accrued for any contingency.

Certain
Terms Used in this Report   

When
this report uses the words  we,   us,   our,  and the  Company,  they refer to
MagneGas Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.  SEC  refers to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

Overview   

MagneGas
Corporation (the  Company ) was organized in the State of Delaware on December 9, 2005.  

The
Company is an alternative energy company that has developed a proprietary plasma arc system ( Plasma Arc Flow Units 
or  Plasma Arc Flow System ) which generates hydrogen based synthetic gases through the gasification of various types
of liquid feedstocks. The Company s synthetic gas   MagneGas2  - is bottled in cylinders and is distributed to
the metalworking market as an alternative cutting fuel to acetylene and propane. Through the course of its business development,
the Company has established a retail and wholesale platform and a network of brokers to sell its MagneGas2  for use in the
metalworking and manufacturing industries throughout the world. Additionally, the Company is in the process of developing ancillary
uses of MagneGas2  for additional end-user applications. The Company s Plasma Arc Flow Units include various commercial
applications, most notably the sterilization of liquid waste, which has resulted in the Company s marketing and sale of
Plasma Arc Flow Units for third-party commercial use.  

In
the second quarter of 2014 the Company began implementing an acquisition-focused growth strategy that was highlighted by the October
2014 purchase of Equipment Sales and Services, Inc. ( ESSI ). ESSI is a full line seller of industrial gases and equipment
for the welding and metal cutting industries. Since acquiring ESSI, the Company has opened four retail locations and distributes
MagneGas2  as a metal cutting fuel as well as other gases and welding supplies. Additional acquisitions and the success of
ESSI has allowed the Company to augment its acquisition growth model with significant organic growth. In January 2018, the Company
acquired all of the assets of GGNG Enterprises, Inc. and began doing business in southern California under the name  Complete
Welding San Diego . In February 2018, the company acquired all of the assets of Green Arc Supply, L.L.C. and began doing
business in Texas and Louisiana under the name  Green Arc Supply . On April 3, 2018, the Company acquired all of the
capital stock of Trico Welding Supplies, Inc. and began doing business in Northern California under the name  Trico Welding
Supplies .  

Between
February and March of 2017, the Company formed five wholly owned subsidiaries in the State of Delaware respectively called MagneGas
Energy Solutions, LLC, MagneGas Welding Supply, LLC, MagneGas Real Estate Holdings, LLC, MagneGas IP, LLC and MagneGas Production,
LLC. The Company formed these entities to hold the various types of Company assets their names indicate. On June 29, 2018, the
Company organized MagneGas Limited under the laws of the United Kingdom and commenced business operations in greater Europe.  

Results
of Operations   

Comparison
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017   

Revenues   

For the three months
ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 we generated revenues of $2,907,712 and $966,204, respectively. The 201% increase in revenue
was due primarily to our acquisition of Trico Welding Supplies, Inc. in Northern California which generated $1,392,757. Organic
sales growth in the area of preexisting operations generated $1,534,574, as compared to $966,204 for the three months ended June
30, 2018. The $568,369 (58.5%) increase in sales outside of Trico was largely due to the expansion of the Company into the East
Texas, Louisiana, and San Diego, California markets via two acquisitions made during the first quarter of 2018. Revenues generated
by ESSI, LLC, the Company s Florida industrial gas and welding supply subsidiary, were $969,140, largely unchanged as compared
to the same period in the prior year. The Company has focused on increased staffing and growth efforts in East Texas and California,
where the Company sees significant growth potential and higher profit margin opportunities. 

For the six months
ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 we generated revenues of $4,079,464 and $1,837,992, respectively. The 122% increase in revenue
was due primarily to the three acquisitions completed year-to-date and organic sales growth in the area of preexisting operations.
These acquisitions contributed $2,218,411 in revenue during the period. The Company s Florida operations generated $1,855,465
during the first six months of 2018, largely unchanged from the same period in the prior year. The Company dedicated virtually
all spare financial and operational resources during the first six months of 2018 to completing, integrating, and implementing
growth plans at three newly acquired business in California, Texas and Louisiana. 

For the three months
ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 cost of revenues were $1,972,586 compared to $532,657, respectively. For the three months ended June
30, 2018 and 2017, we generated a gross profit of $935,126 compared to $433,547. Gross margins for the three months ended June
30, 2018 and 2017 were 32% and 45%, respectively. The decline in gross margins was due to acquisition accounting treatment of
the acquired inventory values. The company recorded $331,061 in additional cost of goods sold during the period due to acquisition
accounting. If this amount were excluded, gross margins would have been 44%. The Company anticipates that margins will improve
as all acquired inventory is sold and our cost basis for replacement inventory is reflected in our future cost of goods sold.
Partially offsetting this increase in cost of goods sold, the Company has achieved better pricing and terms on select products
as we achieve economies of scale and greater buying power. In addition, the Company is currently in the process of installing
a bulk industrial gas fill plant at its Clearwater facilities. These facilities are estimated to further improve combined gross
margins by 3 to 5 percentage points as the Company expects to improve its gas margins in the Florida market. 

For
the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 cost of revenues were $2,730,459 compared to $1,036,045, respectively. For the six
months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, we generated a gross profit of $1,349,005 compared to $801,947. Gross margins for the six
months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were 33% and 44%, respectively. The decline in gross margins was due to acquisition accounting
treatment of the acquired inventory values. The Company anticipates that margins will improve as all acquired inventory is sold
and our cost basis for replacement inventory is reflected in our future cost of goods sold. Partially offsetting this increase
in cost of goods sold, the Company has achieved better pricing and terms on select products as we achieve economies of scale and
greater buying power.

the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were $4,355,964 and $3,524,922, respectively. The increase in our operating

significant non-recurring charges related to integration of these acquisitions. The Company incurred $63,579 in computer and IT
integration activities. Travel expenses were also significantly higher due to ongoing personnel training, integration and other
non-recurring activities. During the six months ended June 30, 2018 we recognized a non-cash charge of $123,674 in stock-based
compensation for employees, compared to $1,882,255 in the comparable six months ended June 30, 2017, common stock issued for services
of $1,203,839 for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $1,639,110 in the comparable three months ended June 30, 2017.
Other non-cash operating expenses were due to depreciation and amortization charges of $579,474 for the six-month period
ended June 30, 2018, compared to $360,568 for the six months ended June 30, 2017. 

In
the current quarter, as in prior quarters, we selectively used common stock as a method of payment for certain services, primarily
the advertising and promotion of the technology to increase investor and customer awareness and as incentive to its key employees
and consultants. We expect to continue these arrangements, though due to a stronger operating position, this method of payment
may become limited to employees.  

Net
Loss   

Our
operating results for the three months ended June 30, 2018 have recognized losses in the amount of $3,495,060 compared to $2,241,777
for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in our loss was primarily attributable to acquisition and integration expenses.  

Our
operating results for the six months ended June 30, 2018 have recognized losses in the amount of $6,514,500 compared to $4,022,936
for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in our loss was primarily attributable to acquisition and integration expenses.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As of June 30, 2018, the Company had cash
of $1,147,522 and has reported a net loss of $6,514,500 and has used cash in operations of $3,974,246 for the six
months ended June 30, 2018. Partly offsetting our negative cash flows, as of June 30, 2018 the Company had a positive working
capital position of $1,235,578, and a stockholder s equity balance of $14,426,449. As a result of the Company s
negative cash flow generation, there is reasonable doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within
one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and
generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of public or private offerings or through the use
of indebtedness.  

Historically, the Company has financed its
operations through equity and debt financing transactions and expects to continue incurring operating losses for the foreseeable
future. The Company s plans and expectations for the next 12 months include raising additional capital to help fund commercial
operations, make select acquisitions, and new product development. The Company utilizes cash in its operations of approximately
$660,000 per month. Management believes, but it cannot be certain, its current holdings of cash along with the cash to
be generated from expected product sales and future financings will be sufficient to meet its projected operating requirements
for the next twelve months from the date of this report. 

Cash
Flows from Continuing Operations   

Cash
flows from continuing operations for operating, financing and investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and
2017 are summarized in the following table:  

For the three months ended June 30, 2018,
we used cash of $3,974,246 in operations in 2018 and used cash of $2,377,367 in operations in 2017. Our cash use for 2018
was primarily attributable to cash used to reduce vendor balances, accrued expenses and other short-term liabilities. Our cash
use for 2017 was primarily attributable to general corporate needs, personnel restructuring, the overhaul of our capital structure,
and organic growth initiatives. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, cash used by investing activities consisted of $5,516,975
primarily due to the acquisition of all of the capital stock of Trico Welding Supplies, Inc. During the three months ended
June 30, 2017, cash used by investing activities consisted of $129,750. Cash provided by financing activities for the six months
ended June 30, 2018 was $10,051,919 as compared to cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June
30, 2017 of $972,273. The net increase in cash during the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $560,698 as compared to a
net decrease in cash of $1,534,844 for the six months ended June 30, 2017. 

Insurance   

The
Company has insurance to cover Liabilities related to environmental and pollution contingencies of $1,000,000 per loss and $2,000,000
in the aggregate.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

Our
significant accounting policies are presented in this Report in our Notes to financial statements, which are contained in this
Quarterly Report. The significant accounting policies that are most critical and aid in fully understanding and evaluating the
reported financial results include the following:  

The
Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These principles require management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management
believes that these estimates are reasonable and have been discussed with our Board of Directors (the  Board ); however,
actual results could differ from those estimates.  

We
issue restricted stock to consultants for various services. Cost for these transactions are measured at the fair value of the
consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of
the common stock is measured at the earlier of (i) the date at which a firm commitment for performance by the counterparty to
earn the equity instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty s performance is complete.  

Long-lived
assets such as property, equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based
on the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar
assets, if available, or independent appraisals, if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable
from its undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value
of the asset. When fair values are not available, the Company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted
at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets.  

The
Company adopted ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method which would require a cumulative effect
adjustment for initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings and the
comparative information would not require to be restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect
for those periods.  

Based
on the Company s analysis the Company did not identify a cumulative effect adjustment for initially applying the new revenue
standards. The Company principally generates revenue through the sales of: (1) MagneGas2 , other industrial gases and welding
supply goods and (2) Plasma Arc Flow Units, either directly or through one or more of its wholly owned welding supply and gas
distribution subsidiaries. The Company s revenue recognition policy for the year ending December 31, 2018 is as follows:  

Revenue
    for metal-working fuel, industrial gases and welding supplies is recognized when performance obligations of the sale are satisfied.
    The majority of the Company s terms of sale have a single performance obligation to transfer products. Accordingly,
    the Company recognizes revenue when control has been transferred to the customer, generally at the time of shipment of products.
    Under the previous revenue recognition accounting standard, the Company recognized revenue upon transfer of title and risk
    of loss, generally upon the delivery of goods.   

Revenue
    generated from sales of a Plasma Arc Flow Unit ( Units ) is no longer recognized on a percentage of completion.
    Even though our Units are cost intensive and generally require a 6 to 9 month production cycle, revenue will now be recognized
    upon shipment of the completed machine. We require purchasers of our Units to make significant payments before we proceed
    with production and at 75% completion; these payments are now classified as customer deposits instead of revenue.    

The
fair value of an embedded conversion option that is convertible into a variable amount of shares and warrants that include price
protection reset provision features are deemed to be  down-round protection  and, therefore, do not meet the scope
exception for treatment as a derivative under Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) ASC 815  Derivatives
and Hedging , since  down-round protection  is not an input into the calculation of the fair value of the conversion
option and warrants and cannot be considered  indexed to the Company s own stock  which is a requirement for
the scope exception as outlined under ASC 815. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the
Company record the embedded conversion option and warrants at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and
at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income
or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. The Company reassesses the classification of its derivative instruments
at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified
as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. As a result of entering into a convertible credit facility for which
such instruments contained a variable conversion feature with no floor, the Company has adopted a sequencing policy in accordance
with ASC 815-40-35-12 whereby all future instruments may be classified as a derivative liability with the exception of instruments
related to share-based compensation issued to employees.  

The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was used to estimate the fair value of the warrants and conversion options. The model includes
subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The Company determined the fair value of the
Binomial Lattice Model and the Black-Scholes Valuation Model to be materially the same. The expected volatility is estimated based
on the most recent historical period of time equal to the weighted average life of the warrants. Conversion options are recorded
as debt discount and are amortized as interest expense over the life of the underlying debt instrument.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Item
3.        Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.    

The
Company is a  Smaller Reporting Company  as defined by   229.10(f)(1) and is not required to provide the information
required by this Item.  

Item
4.        Controls
and Procedures.    

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

In
connection with the preparation of this report, an evaluation was carried out by the Company s management, with the participation
of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ))
as of June 30, 2018. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in
the Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the
chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  

During
the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2018, management concluded that Company s disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective.  

Notwithstanding
the existence of these material weaknesses, management believes that the consolidated financial statements in this report on Form
10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, the Company s financial condition as reported, in conformity with United
States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ).  

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

Management
of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process,
under the supervision of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  

Pertain
    to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
    the Company s assets;   

Provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance
    with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the
    board of directors; and   

Provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s
    assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

Management
has not completed a proper evaluation, risk assessment and monitoring of the company s internal controls over financial
reporting as of June 30, 2018, based on criteria established in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013)  issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ). As a result, management has concluded
controls were not effective and identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.  

A
material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  

The
material weaknesses identified are disclosed below:  

Failure
to Segregate Duties.  Management has not maintained adequate segregation of duties within the Company due to its reliance on
a few individuals to fill multiple roles and responsibilities. Our failure to segregate duties has been a material weakness for
the period covering this report.  

Sufficiency
of Accounting Resources.  The Company has limited accounting personnel to prepare its financial statements and handle complex
accounting transactions. The insufficiency of our accounting resources has been a material weakness for the period covering this
report.  

Evaluation.
 The Company did not perform a proper evaluation, risk assessment or monitor their internal controls over financial reporting.  

As
a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described above, the Company s management
has concluded that, as of June 30, 2018, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective based
on the criteria in Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.  

This
report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. We were not required to have, nor have we, engaged the Company s independent registered
public accounting firm to perform an audit of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the rules of the Securities
and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report.  

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting   

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 that has materially affected
or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION    

Item
1.        Legal
Proceedings.    

The
Company is involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business. Many of these claims
are covered in whole or in part by insurance. Based on knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel,
management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable losses with respect to the resolution of all such claims
and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome, after provisions therefor, will not have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition of the Company, but could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given quarter or year.  

Item
