FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS   

Except
for any historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q contain certain  forward-looking
statements   within the meaning of the federal securities laws. This includes statements regarding our future financial
position, economic performance, results of operations, business strategy, budgets, projected costs, plans and objectives of management
for future operations, and the information referred to under  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations.   

These
forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as  may,  
 will,    expect,    intend,    estimate,    anticipate,  
 believe,    continue   or similar terminology, although not all forward-looking statements
contain these words. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates
and projections about our industry, management s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their
nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, you are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements
are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to
predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date
made, expectations may prove to have been materially different from the results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
Important factors that may cause actual results to differ from projections include, for example:  

the
    success or failure of management s efforts to implement our business plan;   

our
    ability to fund our operating expenses;   

our
    ability to compete with other companies that have a similar business plan;   

the
    effect of changing economic conditions impacting our plan of operation; and   

our
    ability to meet the other risks as may be described in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).   

Unless
otherwise required by law, we also disclaim any obligation to update our view of any such risks or uncertainties or to announce
publicly the result of any revisions to the forward-looking statements made in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  

When
considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in this quarterly report on Form
10-Q and in our other filings with the SEC. We cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this quarterly report
on Form 10-Q will prove to be accurate. Furthermore, if our forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy
may prove to be material. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard
these statements as a representation or warranty by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives and plans in any
specified time-frame, or at all.

NOTE
1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Nature
of Operations and Organization   

Indoor
Harvest Corp. (the  Company, ) is a Texas corporation formed on November 23, 2011. Our principal executive office
is located at 5300 East Freeway Suite A, Houston, Texas 77020. On August 3, 2017, we formed Alamo Acquisition, LLC, a wholly owned
Texas limited liability company ( Alamo Acquisition Sub ). On August 4, 2017, we consummated a business acquisition
(the  Alamo Acquisition ) pursuant to which Alamo Acquisition Sub acquired all of the outstanding member
interests of Alamo CBD, LLC. ( Alamo CBD ), a Texas limited Liability Company. Upon closing of the Alamo Acquisition,
the member interests ( Alamo Surviver Members ) of Alamo CBD were exchanged for 7,584,008 shares of Indoor Harvest s
common stock, the parent company of Alamo Acquisition Sub, and Alamo CBD continued as our surviving wholly-owned subsidiary, and
Alamo Acquisition Sub ceased to exist.  

From
inception until August 4, 2017, the Company provided full service, state of the art design-build, engineering, procurement and
construction services to the indoor and vertical farming industry. The Company provided production platforms, mechanical systems
and complete custom designed build outs for both Controlled Environment Agriculture ( CEA ) and Building Integrated
Agriculture ( BIA ), for two unique industries, produce and cannabis. In mid-2016, the Company began efforts to separate
its produce and cannabis related operations due to ongoing feedback from both clients and potential institutional investors. It
was determined that the Company s involvement in the cannabis industry was creating conflicts for clients and potential
institutional investors wishing to work with the Company from the produce industry due to the public perception and political
issues surrounding the cannabis industry. By late-2016, the Company had decided to cease actively selling its products and services
to the vertical farming industry and to focus on utilizing the Company s developed technology and methods for the cannabis
industry. On August 4, 2017, the Company ceased actively supporting business development of vertical farms for produce production.  

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).  

It
is management s opinion, however, that all material adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring adjustments) have been
made which are necessary for a fair financial statement presentation. The results for the interim period are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for the year.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  

Significant
estimates include, but are not limited to, the estimate of percentage of completion on construction contracts in progress at each
reporting period which we rely on as a primary basis of revenue recognition, estimated useful lives of equipment for purposes
of depreciation and the valuation of common shares issued for services, equipment and the liquidation of liabilities.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Indoor Harvest Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Alamo CBD. All
significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Reclassification   

Certain
expense items have been reclassified in the statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2017, to conform to the
reporting format adopted for the six months ended June 30, 2018.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.  

Stock
Based Compensation   

The
Company recognizes stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718-10, Stock Compensation. ASC 718-10 focuses on transactions
in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus in which an entity obtains employee
services in stock-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions).  

Loss
per Share   

Basic
earnings per share amounts are calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each
period. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average numbers of shares of common stock outstanding for the periods,
including dilutive effects of stock options, warrants granted and convertible preferred stock. Dilutive options and warrants that
are issued during a period or that expire or are canceled during a period are reflected in the computations for the time they
were outstanding during the periods being reported. Since Indoor Harvest has incurred losses for all periods, the impact of the
common stock equivalents would be anti- dilutive and therefore are not included in the calculation.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

We
adopted accounting guidance for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities (ASC 820). The adoption did not have a material
impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for
measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather
applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to
measurements related to share- based payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable
market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the
service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:  

Level
    1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level
    2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar
    assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are
    not active.   

Level
    3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed
    by us, which reflect those that a market participant would use.   

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC 740 Income Taxes, which requires recognition of deferred income tax
liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements
or tax returns. The Company provides for deferred taxes on temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis
of assets using the enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income when the temporary differences are expected
to reverse.  

ASB
ASC 740 establishes a more-likely-than-not threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements.
Also, the statement implements a process for measuring those tax positions that meet the recognition threshold of being ultimately
sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. There are no uncertain tax positions taken by the Company on its tax returns.
The Company files tax returns in the U.S. and states in which it has operations and is subject to taxation.  

Tax
years 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013, remain subject to examination by the IRS and respective states.  

On
December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(the  Tax Reform Act ). We recognize the impact of tax legislation in the period in which the law is enacted. In December
2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which addresses how a company recognizes provisional amounts when
a company does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail
to complete its accounting for the effect of the changes in the Tax Reform Act. Consistent with that guidance, we recognized provisional
amounts based upon our interpretation of the tax laws and estimates which require significant judgments. The actual impact of
these tax laws may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis,
changes in our interpretations and assumptions, additional guidance that may be issued by the government and actions we may take
as a result of these enacted tax laws. Any adjustments recorded to the provisional amounts will be included in income from operations
as an adjustment to tax expense.  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of
the asset or the underlying lease term for leasehold improvements, whichever is shorter. The estimated useful life by asset description
is noted in the following table:  

Asset
    description   
         
       Estimated
    Useful Life (Years)

*
The shorter of 5 years or the life of the lease.  

Additions
are capitalized and maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Gains and losses on dispositions of equipment
are reflected in other income.  

Goodwill   

In
accordance with ASC 350 Goodwill is not amortized but evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential
impairment are present.  

Intangible
Assets   

In
accordance with ASC 350 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated
for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present. Indefinite-lived intangible assets
consist of the Company s domain name. Finite-lived intangible assets include software and is amortized over a 3 to 5 year
period.  

Derivative
Liability   

The
Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments and hedging activities, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments
or contracts and requires recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, regardless of hedging relationship
designation. Accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives qualify as
hedge relationships and the types of relationships designated are based on the exposures hedged. At June 30, 2018 and December
31, 2017, the Company did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges.  

Beneficial
Conversion Feature   

For
conventional convertible debt where the rate of conversion is below market value, the Company records a  beneficial conversion
feature  ( BCF ) and related debt discount.  

When
the Company records a BCF, the relative fair value of the BCF is recorded as a debt discount against the face amount of the respective
debt instrument. The discount is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt.  

Patent
and Patent Application Expenses   

Although
the Company believes that its patent and underlying technology will have continuing value, the amount of future benefits to be
derived from the patent is uncertain. Therefore, patent costs are expensed as incurred.  

Research
and Development   

Research
and development expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development expense for the six months ended June
30, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:  

Advertising
Expense   

Advertising
and promotional costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense for the Six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

Management
has evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were available to be issued. Based on our evaluation
no material events have occurred that require disclosure.  

NOTE
2 - GOING CONCERN    

As
reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had a net loss of $1,180,541, net cash used in operations of $378,629
and has an accumulated deficit of $9,589,363, for the six months ended June 30, 2018. These factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on Management s plans which include potential asset acquisitions,
mergers or business combinations with other entities, further implementation of its business plan and continuing to raise funds
through debt or equity financings. The Company will likely rely upon related party debt or equity financing in order to ensure
the continuing existence of the business.  

The
business plan of the Company is to engage in the design, development, marketing and direct-selling of commercial grade aeroponics
fixtures and supporting systems for use in urban Controlled Environment Agriculture ( CEA ) and Building Integrated
Agriculture ( BIA ). During the next twelve months, the Company s strategy is to: complete ongoing product development;
commence product marketing, product assembly and sales; construct a demonstration CEA and BIA farm; and offer design-build services.
The Company s long-term strategy is to direct sale, license and franchise their patented technologies and methods.  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be
unable to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
3 - PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT    

Property
and equipment consist of the following as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017:  

Depreciation
expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, totaled $5,197 and $25,402, respectively.  

NOTE
4   INTANGIBLE ASSETS    

There were no impairment charges taken for
the domain name during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. 

Intangible
assets consist of the following as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017:  

Amortization
expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, totaled $858 and $854, respectively.  

NOTE
5 - COMMITMENTS   CONTINGENCIES    

On
February 20, 2014, the Company signed a 60-month lease on a 10,000 sq. ft. office/warehouse facility and paid a deposit of $12,600.
The monthly base rent is $4,200 increasing 6% every two years for the term of the lease. The property is adequate for all of the
Company s currently planned activities. On January 22, 2018, the Company entered into a 6-month sublease agreement for a
portion of the 10,000 sq. ft. office/warehouse facility. The term of the sublease is February 1, 2018 through July 31, 2018 at
$2,000 per month. The Company records the sublease income as a reduction of rent expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
within general and administrative expenses.  

Deferred
rent payable at June 30, 2018 was $4,568. Deferred rent payable is the sum of the difference between the monthly rent payment
and the straight-line monthly rent expense of an operating lease that contains escalated payments in future periods.  

Rent
expense, net of sublease payments received, for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:  

NOTE
6 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS    

Carrying
amounts reported on the balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses
approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturity. Debt classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy represent
convertible notes payable of $732,119 and $455,459 at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Financial instruments
classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy represents derivative liability of $550,374 and $554,917 June 30, 2018 and December
31, 2017, respectively.  

NOTE
7 - NOTE PAYABLE    

On
June 5, 2015, the Company entered into a five-year loan agreement totaling $36,100. The loan carries interest at a rate of 10.25%.  

NOTE
8 - CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE    

Convertible
notes payable at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 are as follows:  

Note
1   

On
March 24, 2017, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with Tangiers Global, LLC ( Tangiers ) relating
to the issuance and sale of notes ( Note 1 ) in the aggregate principal amount of up to $550,000, which includes a
10% original issue discount. Note 1 is convertible into shares of common stock at a price equal to $0.30 per share; provided,
however that if Note 1 is not retired on or before the maturity date, defined in Note 1 as a  Maturity Default  the
conversion price shall be adjusted to be equal to the lower of: (i) $0.30 or (ii) 65% multiplied by the lowest trading price of
the Company s common stock in the fifteen (15) consecutive trading day period immediately preceding the date that the Company
receives a notice of conversion. The Tangiers Note 1 carries interest on the unpaid principal amount at the rate of 8% per annum
and is due and payable eight months from the effective date of each payment. As of June 30, 2018, the balance under Note 1 is
$294,000, which includes $44,000 guaranteed interest. As of June 30, 2018, Note 1 can be converted into 4,184,615 shares of the
Company s common stock.  

On
October 12, 2017, the Company entered into an Investment Agreement with Tangiers. Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement,
Tangiers committed to purchase up to $2,000,000 of our common stock over a period of up to 36 months. From time to time during
the 36-month period commencing from the effectiveness of the registration statement, we may deliver a put notice to Tangiers which
states the dollar amount that we intend to sell to Tangiers on a date specified in the put notice. The maximum investment amount
per notice must be no more than 200% of the average daily trading dollar volume of our common stock for the eight (8) consecutive
trading days immediately prior to date of the applicable put notice and such amount must not exceed an accumulative amount of
$250,000. The minimum put amount is $5,000. The purchase price per share to be paid by Tangiers will be the 80% of the of the
average of the two lowest closing bid prices of the common stock during the pricing period applicable to the put notice, provided,
however, an additional 10% will be added to the discount of each put if (i) we are not DWAC eligible and (ii) an additional 15%
will be added to the discount of each put if we are under DTC  chill  status on the applicable date of the put notice.  

On
October 10, 2017, the Company executed Amendment #1 to the Tangiers Note 1 for a final draw of $250,000 payment plus a 10% original
issue discount. Amendment #1 modified the maturity date for the Tangier Note from eight months to six months from the effective
date of each payment. All other terms and conditions of the Tangiers Note 1 remain effective.  

The
execution of Amendment #1 to Note 1 on October 10, 2017 caused the Company to default on the first draw due under Note 1 due to
the acceleration of the maturity date. The default allows Tangiers to demand payment in cash equal to 150% of the outstanding
principal and interest, which is automatically added to the outstanding principle, and convert all or a portion of the outstanding
principal into shares of common stock of the Company. The default conversion rate of Note 1 is now the lower of the conversion
rate then in effect or 65% of the lowest trading price for the 15 days prior to Tangiers  notice of conversion. As of May
1, 2018, Tangiers has informed the Company that they have elected at this time not to enforce the default interest rate of 18%
under Note 1 and also not to enforce the fees, reserving its rights to enforce the foregoing in their discretion.  

Note
2   

The
Company issued a fixed convertible promissory note to Tangiers for the principal sum of $50,000 as a commitment fee for the Investment
Agreement. The promissory note ( Note 2 ) maturity date is May 12, 2018. The principal amount due under Note 2 can
be converted by Tangiers any time, into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of $0.1666 per share.
The promissory note is in a  Maturity Default,  which is defined in Note 2 as the event in which Note 2 is not retired
prior to its maturity date, Tangiers  conversion rights under Note 2 would be adjusted such that the conversion price would
be the lower of (i) $0.1666 or (ii) b) 65% of the average of the two lowest trading prices of the Company s common stock
during the 10 consecutive trading days prior to the date on which Tangiers elects to convert all or part of the note. The default
interest rate is 20%. As of June 30, 2018, the balance under Note 2 is $55,000, which includes $5,000 guaranteed interest. As
of June 30, 2018, Note 2 can be converted into 769,231 shares of the Company s common stock.  

Note
3   

On
January 16, 2018, the Company issued and sold an 8% Fixed Convertible Promissory Note ( Note 3 ) to Tangiers (the
 Buyer ), in the aggregate principal amount of up to $550,000, which includes a 10% original issue discount. Note
3 is convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of $0.30 per share. However, if Note 3
is not paid back on or before the maturity date, defined in Note 3 as a  Maturity Default , the conversion price of
Note 3 shall then be adjusted to be equal to the lower of: (i) $0.30 or (ii) 65% multiplied by the lowest trading price of the
Company s common stock in the fifteen (15) consecutive trading day period immediately preceding the trading day that the
Company receives a notice of conversion of Note 3.  

On
February 13, 2018, April 17, 2018, and June 13, 2018, the Company executed Amendments #1, #2, and #3 to the Tangiers Note 3 for
draws of $132,000, $132,000, and $101,750, respectively. All other terms and conditions of the Tangiers Note 3 remain effective.
As of June 30, 2018, the balance under Note 3 is $484,110, which includes $35,860 guaranteed interest.  

As
of June 30, 2018, the Company accrued $96,226 in interest expense related to the outstanding the notes.  

Debt
Discount and Original Issuance Costs for Convertible Note   

The
debt discount amount consists of debt discount due to beneficial conversion features, warrant, original issue costs, and debt
issue costs. The debt discounts recorded in 2018 and 2017, pertain to beneficial conversion feature on the convertible notes.
The notes are required to be bifurcated and reported at fair value on the date of grant.  

During
the six months ended June 30, 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company amortized $109,910 and $466,862 to interest
expense, respectively.  

Debt
Issuance Costs for Convertible Note   

During

NOTE
9 - DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES    

The
Company identified the conversion features embedded within its convertible debts as financial derivatives. The Company has determined
that the embedded conversion option should be accounted for at fair value.

General
Overview   

We
are a Texas corporation formed on November 23, 2011. Our principal executive office is located at 5300 East Freeway Suite A, Houston,
Texas 77020. On August 3, 2017, we formed Alamo Acquisition, LLC, a wholly owned Texas limited liability company ( Alamo
Acquisition Sub ).  

On
August 4, 2017, we consummated a business acquisition (the  Alamo Acquisition ) pursuant to which Alamo
Acquisition Sub acquired all of the outstanding member interests of Alamo CBD, LLC. ( Alamo CBD ), a Texas limited
Liability Company. Upon closing of the Alamo Acquisition, the member interests ( Alamo Surviver Members ) of
Alamo CBD were exchanged for 7,584,008 shares of Indoor Harvest s common stock, the parent company of Alamo Acquisition
Sub, and Alamo CBD continued as our surviving wholly-owned subsidiary, and Alamo Acquisition Sub ceased to exist.  

In
addition to the foregoing, following the closing of the Alamo Acquisition, and Alamo CBD being successfully awarded a provisional
or full license to produce and dispense cannabis in the State of Texas, Indoor Harvest will issue to the individual Alamo Surviver
Members, an additional Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($8,500,000) of newly-issued shares of common stock of Indoor
Harvest, par value $0.001, based upon the three (3) day average closing price of the Company s common stock, as quoted on
the OTCQB, prior to the time of issuance.  

Additionally,
upon Alamo CBD successfully being registered and licensed by the DEA to produce and dispense cannabis under federal law, Indoor
Harvest will issue to the individual Alamo Surviver Members, an additional Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000)
cash payment, or newly-issued shares of common stock of Indoor Harvest, par value $0.001, based upon the three (3) day average
closing price of the Company s common stock, as quoted on the OTCQB, prior to the time of issuance, at the option of the
individual Alamo Surviver Member. A combination of cash and common stock may be elected by Alamo Surviver Member individually.  

Our
Current Business   

Indoor
Harvest, through its brand name Indoor Harvest , is a technology company focused on producing bio pharma grade cannabis for
research and development and a provider of advanced cultivation methods and processes for the cannabis industry. We are seeking
to use the proprietary technology we have developed to become a registered producer and seller under the federal Controlled
Substances Act ( CSA ) of pharmaceutical grade cannabis for research and targeted treatment of specific medical
symptoms by third parties.  

We
have developed a patent pending aeroponic process of growing cultivars in an air or mist environment without the use of soil or
an aggregate growing medium. Aeroponic production differs from both conventional hydroponics and in-vitro (plant tissue culture)
growing. Unlike hydroponics, which uses water as a growing medium and essential minerals to sustain plant growth, aeroponics is
conducted without a growing medium. Because water is used in aeroponics to transmit nutrients, it is sometimes considered a type
of hydroponics. Our aeroponic process and production methods provide an ability to test the phenotypic plasticity of cannabis
and to test and develop specific phenotypic response. Phenotypic plasticity refers to the changes in cannabis morphology and physiology
due to its adaption to a unique environment and its impact on phytochemical production.  

We,
through Alamo CBD, have applied to produce and dispense low-tetrahydrocannabinol cannabis under the Texas Compassionate Use Program.
THC is a psychotropic cannabinoid and is the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis. We have signed a binding LOI with
Zoned Properties outlining three independent pending agreements to complete research and development projects for licensed medical
cannabis facilities to be located in Tempe, Arizona, Parachute, Colorado and Stockdale, Texas or other location to be determined
after approval of a provisional license under the Texas Compassionate Use Program ( TCUP ). The Company intends
to generate revenue from production of cannabis under the TCUP, through related engineering, project management, equipment leasing
and technology licensing from constructed facilities in Tempe, Arizona and Parachute, Colorado and through the development and
licensing of related environmental and climate recipes.  

Our
operational expenditures are primarily related to further developing our technology, launching and completing test trials, developing
research partnerships and collaborations related to perfecting precise expressions of personalized medicine and the costs related
to being a fully reporting company with the SEC.  

Current
Operations    

On
July 10, 2017, we entered into a Cultivation Design Agreement with Bright Orchard Developments, Ltd. ( Bright Orchard ),
for the design of an aeroponic cannabis production facility by a pending licensed producer in Canada. On July 25, 2018, we received
formal cancelation of the agreement from Bright Orchard.  

On
October 11, 2017, we entered into a binding letter of intent ( LOI ) with Zoned Properties outlining three pending
independent agreements to complete research and development projects for licensed medical cannabis facilities to be located in
Tempe, Arizona, Parachute, Colorado and Stockdale, Texas or other location to be determined after approval of a provisional license
under the TCUP. Zoned Properties is an OTCQX quoted company and strategic real estate development firm whose primary mission is
to identify, develop, and lease sophisticated, safe, and sustainable properties in emerging industries, including the licensed
medical cannabis industry.  

Under
the terms of the binding LOI, the two companies will work together to mutually agree upon terms, provisions and obligations of
three simultaneous, independent agreements.  

Tempe
                                         Arizona Research Cultivation Site   an agreement for the development and installation
                                         of a research cultivation site utilizing Indoor Harvest s cultivation technology
                                         and equipment within at most 2,500 square feet of space at Zoned Properties  Tempe

                                         to engage Zoned Properties as the exclusive Strategic Development Advisory.   

Texas
                                         Compassionate Use Program Applicant   an agreement for Indoor Harvest to engage
                                         Zoned Properties as the exclusive Strategic Development Advisory for Indoor Harvest s
                                         anticipated future development located in Stockdale, Texas or at another location to
                                         be determined.    

Execution
of any of the three individual agreements is subject to, among other things, satisfactory due diligence and the negotiation and
execution of definitive agreements, each of which will contain customary representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions.
There is no assurance that any or all of the agreements will be executed nor consummated.  

The
binding LOI includes non-refundable payments totaling $50,000 by our company to Zoned Properties. The payments are consideration
for entering into the binding LOI and represents a 20% deposit to be applied towards the assignment of the Parachute Development
Rights which have been valued at $250,000 within the binding LOI.  

On
October 26, 2017, we entered into a LOI with Harvest Air, LLC ( Harvest Air ) and on November 1, 2017, entered into
a LOI with Biological Innovations and Optimization Systems, LLC ( BIOS Lighting ). The two companies plan to collaborate
with our company towards the development of a fully integrated platform designed to provide cannabis producers the ability to
manage and record phenotypic plasticity in the cannabis plant. By combining our proven aeroponic methods, Harvest Air s
HVAC designs, and customized lighting solutions from BIOS Lighting, the three companies plan to demonstrate an ability to manipulate
and control phenotypic expression in the cannabis plant for the purpose of research and production of pharmaceuticals.  

In
addition to collaborative research and development, the group plans to develop advanced automation strategies to control the growth
of cultivars with high pressure aeroponics by integrating power generation, HVAC, LED lighting systems, phytometric devices, and
near-infrared technologies, into a fully integrated facilities package. By using real time measurements of plant physiological
processes and precision management of the production facility environment, the group intends to offer scalable solutions and production
methods designed specifically for cannabis phytochemistry and precise phytochemical production.  

Prototype
development will take place in Tempe, Arizona, as part of our planned cannabis technology development described below. In exchange
for Harvest Air and BIOS Lighting support and services, we have agreed to exclusively utilize any developed hardware or strategies
provided by both companies in its future developments in Parachute, Colorado and Stockdale, Texas, or other location in Texas
approved under the TCUP as described in more detail below.  

Tempe
Arizona Research Cultivation Site    

Our
company plans to install 20 HPA Tables at an existing licensed medical cannabis production facility at Zoned Properties 
Tempe Medical Marijuana Business Park. The purpose of this project is to conduct a demonstration of our company s aeroponic
technology while integrating LED and HVAC designs, provided by BIOS Lighting and Harvest Air, respectively. The resulting demonstration
will be compared to traditional flood irrigation, HVAC and lighting methods. Our company plans to prepare a case study and white
paper to showcase industry adoption value and to serve as a proof of concept for the construction of larger facilities in Parachute,
Colorado and Stockdale, Texas, or other location in Texas approved under the TCUP.  

Both
Zoned Properties and our company agreed to work together in good faith to mutually agree upon the terms, provisions and
obligations of an agreement for the development, installation, and research of our cultivation technology and equipment within
at most 2,500 square feet of space at Zoned Properties  Tempe Medical Marijuana Business Park located at 410 S. Madison
Dr. Tempe, Arizona 85281. Our company expects to generate revenue from the Tempe, Arizona facility through future leasing and
licensing agreements. The 20 HPA Table installation is expected to produce over 206 pounds of cannabis annually at under $150
per pound in cost of goods with an expected breakeven point of 430 pounds for the equipment. There is no assurance that any or
all of the agreements will be executed nor consummated.  

Parachute
Colorado Production Facility    

Our
company has secured rights to develop Zoned Properties Parachute Medical Marijuana Business Park. Our company intends to construct
a 25,000 square foot facility based on the technology developed and tested at the Tempe Arizona Research Cultivation Site and
to generate revenue through the leasing of the facility and licensing of our company s technology to either a medical or
recreational licensee, which has yet to be determined. We would additionally conduct research and development towards creating
specific environmental and climate recipes for the production of cannabis in order to produce and replicate a desired phenotypic
response. Our company also expects to file an application with the DEA to register the facility under the CSA and to obtain rights
to acquire the operating license from the licensee upon changes in Colorado law, which currently does not allow direct ownership
by a publicly traded company.  

Both
Zoned Properties and our company agreed to work together in good faith to mutually agree upon the terms, provisions and
obligations of an agreement for the assignment and/or sale of Zoned Properties  Parachute Development Rights for the Parachute
Marijuana Business Park located at Lot #7 N. Diamond Loop Rd, Parachute, Colorado 81635. The agreement would include: (a) the
assignment and/or sale of the Parachute Development Rights from Zoned Properties to our company, and (b) the engagement by our
company of Zoned Properties as the exclusive Strategic Development Advisor for the Parachute Property. Our company has paid a
$25,000 deposit towards securing these rights. There is no assurance that any or all of the additional agreements will be executed
or that our company will be successful in registering the facility with the DEA.  

Texas
Compassionate Use Program Applicant    

We,
through our wholly owned subsidiary Alamo CBD, have applied to produce and dispense low-THC cannabis under the TCUP. Our company
plans to partner with Zoned Properties, Harvest Air and BIOS Lighting to develop a 50,000 square foot facility in Stockdale, Texas
or other location to be determined after approval of a provisional license under the TCUP. Zoned Properties and our company agreed
to work together in good faith to mutually agree upon the terms, provisions and obligations of an Agreement for our company
to engage Zoned Properties as the exclusive Strategic Development Advisory for our company s development in Texas under
the TCUP. Our company also expects to file an application with the DEA to register the facility under the CSA. Our company expects
to generate revenue through the production and sale of cannabis under the TCUP. There is no assurance that any or all of the agreements
will be executed or that we will be successful in obtaining a license to produce cannabis in Texas or in registering the completed
facility with the DEA.  

As
published in the Texas DPS Self-Evaluation Report, on page 543, question (D), dated September 29, 2017, the DPS originally interpreted
the statute as requiring a market-based system by which the number and location of licensees are determined by market factors
rather than by regulation   as not mandating or limiting the number of licensed distributors. It was originally understood
that the applicants would be required to satisfy certain basic requirements prior to licensure, and the ability to maintain compliance
with DPS guidelines will be evaluated through on-going audits and inspections.  

In
late 2016, the DPS modified its approach to restrict the number of licenses to three. This necessitated the development of a competitive
review process, where three applicants were conditionally approved based on the review of the submitted application materials.
Upon successful onsite inspection of their facilities, qualified applicants will be issued licenses. Because of this competitive
review process, Alamo CBD placed 16th out of 43 applicants and its application is currently considered pending by the DPS. Our
company and other pending applicants have questioned the last minute modification in approach by the DPS and the lack of transparency
in the reviewing process.  

Our
company is a member of and is working with the Medical Cannabis Association of Texas and expects both lobbying and legislative
efforts currently being undertaken to result in the program being expanded, additional permits being awarded, and new legislation
being introduced in 2019 to allow for a separate permitting process to conduct cannabis research in line with the CSA. There is
no guarantee that these efforts will result in our company obtaining a license or permit to produce cannabis in Texas or that
legislation will be adopted allowing a separate licensing or permitting process for research purposes.  

There
can be no assurance that any of the foregoing plans can occur as planned or at all.  

Results
of Operations   

The
following summary of our operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.  

Three
months ended June 30, 2018 compared to three months ended June 30, 2017.   

We
earned no revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017.  

Total
operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 were $311,522 and $420,459 respectively, for an
aggregate decrease of $108,937 or -26%. The decrease is primarily related to a reduction in professional fees.  

Total
other expense for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was $(741,799) and total other expense for the three months ended June
30, 2017 was $(301,232), for an increase in loss of $440,567 or 146%. The increase is primarily related to the embedded derivative
liability related to the Tangiers convertible notes payable.  

As
a result of the factors discussed above, net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 was $1,053,321 and
$724,385, respectively, for an increase in net loss of $328,936 or 45%.  

Six
months ended June 30, 2018 compared to six months ended June 30, 2017.   

We
earned no revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017.  

Total
operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 were $584,125 and $1,147,284 respectively, for an
aggregate decrease of $563,159 or -49%. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in general and administrative expenses
and professional fees.  

Total
other expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $596,416 and total other expense for the six months ended June 30, 2017
was $618,923, for an improvement of $22,507 or -4%. The improvement is primarily related to a positive change in the fair value
of the embedded derivative liability related to the Tangiers convertible notes payable, a decrease in interest expenses related
to the paydown of the FirstFire Notes and Chuck Rifici Notes and a decrease in amortization of debt discount.  

As
a result of the factors discussed above, net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 was $1,180,541 and
$1,780,636, respectively, for a decrease in net loss of $600,095 or -34%.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

The
following table provides selected financial data about our company as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

Capital   

Cash
Flows

at June 30, 2018 our company s cash balance was $60,661 and total assets were $147,721. As at December 31, 2017, our company s
cash balance was $35,453 and total assets were $133,020.

as at December 31, 2017. The increase in working capital deficiency was primarily attributed to an increase in convertible notes
payable and accounts payable and accrued expenses.  

Cash
Flow from Operating Activities   

Net
cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017 were $378,629 and $988,218, respectively,
for a decrease of $609,589 or -62%. The improvement in net cash used in operating activities is primarily related to a reduction
in general and administrative expenses and professional fees.

Cash
Requirements: Potential Future Planned Operational Activities    

During
the next 12 months, we anticipate engaging in the additional planned operational activities set forth in the table below, although
we may vary our plans depending upon operational conditions and available funding.  

Existing
Cash and Operational Cash Flow    

During
the next twelve months, we anticipate that we will incur a minimum of approximately $560,000 of general and administrative expenses
and $1,000,000 in development expenses in order to execute our current business plans. We also plan to incur significant sales,
marketing, research and development expenses during the next 12 months. We must obtain additional financing to continue our operations.
We may not be able to obtain additional funding on terms that are favorable to us or at all. We may not be able to obtain sufficient
funding to continue our operations, or if we do receive funding, to generate adequate revenues in the future or to operate profitably
in the future. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  

Meeting
Cash Requirements    

Based
upon the assumption of our monthly current operational burn rate remaining unchanged during the fiscal year, exclusive of those
costs in our additional planned operations for the next 12, months as set forth above, our company will need to raise additional
funds to implement its business plans. There is no assurance we will obtain the anticipated funds from our sources of funding.
If we don t obtain additional funding, and we don t take other measures such as cutting back operational activities,
we may not have sufficient funds to continue operations for the next 12 months. During the first half of 2018, our company laid-off
two employees.  

The
ability to fund our operational activities is contingent upon us obtaining additional financing. If we don t obtain additional
funding needed for current operational activities, we may not be able to finance our additional planned operations and continue
growing our business.  

We
cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations, both current and potential future operations as described above.  

We
cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient financial resources to fund current operational activities and additional planned
operational activities. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including
the financial risks associated with the limited capital resources currently available to us for the implementation of our business
strategies. To become profitable and competitive, we must continue to execute our business plan as described above.  

We
have an accumulated deficit and have incurred operating losses since our inception and expect losses to continue during 2018.
Our auditor has indicated in their Report that these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that are material to stockholders.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

As
a  smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer
or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.  

An
evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2018. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in SEC rules and forms as a result of the following material weaknesses:  

The
specific material weakness identified by our management was ineffective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting
process because of a lack of a sufficient complement of personnel with a level of accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory
review structure that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements and inadequate segregation of duties. A  material
weakness  is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our company s annual or interim financial statements would not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  

We
expect to be materially dependent upon a third party to provide us with accounting consulting services for the foreseeable future.
Currently our founder, Chad Sykes, is acting as Principal Accounting Officer and Principal Financial Officer. Until such time
as we have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise in U.S. GAAP, there are no assurances that the material weaknesses
in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will not result in errors in our financial
statements which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements.  

Changes
in Internal Controls    

On
June 27, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the termination of Annette Knebel from her position as Chief Financial
Officer of the Company pursuant to the terms of Mr. Knebel s employment agreement with the Company effective immediately
and further on the same date, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the termination of Mr. Knebel from her position as
a member of the Company s Board of Directors consistent with the Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws, effective
immediately.  

Effective
July 3, 2018, Chad Sykes was appointed to act as the Company s principal financial officer and principal accounting officer.  

On
June 27, 2018, the Company entered into an accounting services agreement (the  AS Agreement ) with PubCo Reporting
Solutions, Inc. ( PubCo ). Pursuant to the AS Agreement, the Company engaged PubCo to provide accounting services
including the preparation of the Company s financial statements and assistance with the preparation of the Company s
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

Other
than the foregoing, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with
the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that occurred in the quarter ended
June 30, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

From
time to time we may become involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including actions
related to our intellectual property. Although the outcomes of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, other
than as previously disclosed, we are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe, either individually
or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

4.
I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the
registrant and have:  

(a)
Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by
others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;  

(b)
Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed

reporting;  

5.

and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):  

(a)
All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
and  

(b)
Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
internal control over financial reporting.
