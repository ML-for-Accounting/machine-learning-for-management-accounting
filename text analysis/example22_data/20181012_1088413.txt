1. Basis of Financial Statements  

In
the opinion of Greystone Logistics, Inc. ( Greystone ), the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements
contain all adjustments and reclassifications, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present fairly its financial
position as of August 31, 2018, the results of its operations for the three months ended August 31, 2018 and 2017, and its cash
flows for the three months ended August 31, 2018 and 2017. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018 and the notes thereto included
in Greystone s Form 10-K for such period. The results of operations for the three-month periods ended August 31, 2018 and
2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year.  

The
consolidated financial statements of Greystone include its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Greystone Manufacturing, L.L.C. ( GSM )
and Plastic Pallet Production, Inc. ( PPP ), and the variable interest entity, Greystone Real Estate, L.L.C. ( GRE ).
GRE owns two buildings located in Bettendorf, Iowa which are leased to GSM. All material intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.  

Note
2. Earnings Per Share  

Basic
earnings per share is based on the weighted-average effect of all common shares issued and outstanding and is calculated by dividing
net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
share is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares used
in the basic earnings per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion
of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding.  

Greystone
excludes equity instruments from the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the effect of including such instruments is
anti-dilutive. For the three months ended August 31, 2018 and 2017, equity instruments which have been excluded are Greystone s
convertible preferred stock which is convertible into 3,333,333 shares of common stock.  

The
following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended August 31, 2018
and 2017:

Note
6. Debt  

Debt
as of August 31, 2018 and May 31, 2018 is as follows:  

The
prime rate of interest as of August 31, 2018 was 5.00%. Effective September 27, 2018, the prime rate of interest increased to
5.25%.  

Loan
Agreement between Greystone and IBC    

The
Loan Agreement ( IBC Loan Agreement ), dated January 31, 2014, among Greystone and GSM (the  Borrowers )
and International Bank of Commerce ( IBC ), as amended, provides for certain term loans and a revolver loan.  

Effective
August 10, 2018, the Borrowers and IBC entered into the Sixth Amendment to the IBC Loan Agreement providing (i) an advancing Term
Loan F of $3,600,000 with a maturity date of February 8 2021 for the procurement of production equipment and (ii) an extension
of the maturity date of Term Loan A to April 30, 2023.  

The
IBC term loans make equal monthly payments of principal and interest in such amounts sufficient to amortize the principal balance
of (i) Term Loan A over a seven-year period beginning January 31, 2016 (currently $76,692 per month), (ii) Term Loan C over a
seven-year period beginning August 31, 2017 (currently $25,205 per month) and (iii) Term Loan D over a four-year period beginning
August 4, 2020 (currently $57,469 per month). Term Loan E and Term Loan F require monthly interest payments through December 10,
2018 and January 28, 2019, respectively, after which monthly payments of principal and interest are required in an amount sufficient
to amortize the loans over a four-year and a five-year period, respectively. The monthly payments of principal and interest on
the IBC term loans may vary as a result of changes in the prime rate of interest.  

The
IBC Loan Agreement, as amended, provides a revolving loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $3,000,000 (the  Revolving
Loan ). The exact amount which can be borrowed under the Revolving Loan from time to time is dependent upon the amount of
the borrowing base, but can in no event exceed $3,000,000. The Revolving Loan bears interest at the greater of the prime rate
of interest plus 0.5%, or 4.75% and matures January 31, 2020. The Borrowers are required to pay all interest accrued on the outstanding
principal balance of the Revolving Loan on a monthly basis. Any principal on the Revolving Loan that is prepaid by the Borrowers
does not reduce the original amount available to the Borrowers.  

The
IBC Loan Agreement includes customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants which include (i)
requiring the Borrowers to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of 1:25 to 1:00 and a funded debt to EBIDA ratio not exceeding
3:00 to 1:00 measured quarterly, (ii) subject to certain exceptions, limiting the Borrowers  combined capital expenditures
on fixed assets to $1,500,000 per year, (iii) prohibiting Greystone, without IBC s prior written consent, from declaring
or paying any dividends, redemptions of stock or membership interests, distributions and withdrawals (as applicable) in respect
of its capital stock or any other equity interest, other than additional payments to holders of its preferred stock in an amount
not to exceed $500,000 in any fiscal year, (iv) subject to certain exceptions, prohibiting the incurrence of additional indebtedness
by the Borrowers, and (v) requiring the Borrowers to prevent (A) any change in capital ownership such that there is a material
change in the direct or indirect ownership of (1) Greystone s outstanding preferred stock, and (2) any equity interest in
GSM, or (B) Warren Kruger from ceasing to be actively involved in the management of Greystone as President and/or Chief Executive
Officer. The foregoing list of covenants is not exhaustive and there are several other covenants contained in the IBC Loan Agreement.  

As
of August 31, 2018, management has concluded that Greystone was in compliance with the covenants of the IBC Loan Agreement.  

The
IBC Loan Agreement includes customary events of default, including events of default relating to non-payment of principal and
other amounts owing under the IBC Loan Agreement from time to time, inaccuracy of representations, violation of covenants, defaults
under other agreements, bankruptcy and similar events, the death of a guarantor, certain material adverse changes relating to
a Borrower or guarantor, certain judgments or awards against a Borrower, or government action affecting a Borrower s or
guarantor s ability to perform under the IBC Loan Agreement or the related loan documents. Among other things, a default
under the IBC Loan Agreement would permit IBC to cease lending funds under the IBC Loan Agreement, and require immediate repayment
of any outstanding notes with interest and any unpaid accrued fees.  

The
IBC Loan Agreement is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Borrowers. In addition, the IBC Loan Agreement
is secured by a mortgage granted by GRE on the real property owned by GRE in Bettendorf, Iowa (the  Mortgage ). GRE
is owned by Warren F. Kruger, Greystone s President and CEO, and Robert B. Rosene, Jr., a director of Greystone. Messrs.
Kruger and Rosene have provided a combined limited guaranty of the Borrowers  obligations under the IBC Loan Agreement,
with such guaranty being limited to a combined amount of $6,500,000 (the  Guaranty ). The Mortgage and the Guaranty
also secure or guaranty, as applicable, the obligations of GRE under the Loan Agreement between GRE and IBC dated January 31,
2014 as discussed in the following paragraph.  

Loan
Agreement between GRE and IBC    

On
August 10, 2018, GRE and IBC entered into an amended agreement to extend the maturity of the note to April 30, 2023 and increase
the interest rate to 5.5% interest rate. The note is secured by a mortgage on the two buildings in Bettendorf, Iowa which are
leased to Greystone.  

Note
Payable between Greystone and Robert B. Rosene, Jr.    

Effective
December 15, 2005, Greystone entered into an agreement with Robert B. Rosene, Jr., a member of Greystone s board of directors,
to convert $2,066,000 of advances into an unsecured note payable at 7.5% interest. Effective June 1, 2016, the note was restated
(the  Restated Note ) to combine the outstanding principal, $2,066,000, and accrued interest, $2,475,690, into an
unsecured note payable of $4,541,690 with an extended maturity date of January 15, 2020. The Restated Note provides that accrued
interest is payable monthly and allows Greystone to use commercially reasonable efforts to pay such amounts as allowed by the
IBC Loan Agreement against the interest accrued prior to the restatement. The balance of the note at August 31, 2018 was $4,467,330.  

Note
Payable between Greystone and Yorktown Management Financial Services, LLC ( Yorktown )    

On
February 29, 2016, Greystone entered into an unsecured note payable to Yorktown in the amount of $688,296 in connection with the
acquisition of equipment from Yorktown. The note payable bears interest at the rate of 5% and is payable over three years with
monthly principal and interest payments of $20,629.  

Maturities    

Maturities
of Greystone s long-term debt for the five years subsequent to August 31, 2018 are $2,511,874, $11,117,939, $2,521,897,
$1,836,662 and $2,264,895.  

Note
7. Capital Leases  

Capital
leases as of August 31, 2018 and May 31, 2018:  

Greystone
and an unrelated private company entered into three lease agreements for certain production equipment with a total cost of approximately
$9.9 million. The first agreement, dated August 7, 2016, was a three-year lease agreement for two injection molding machines and
pallet molds, interest rate of 5.0% and maturity date of August 7, 2019 ( Agreement A ). The remaining two agreements,
dated February 24, 2018 and August 2, 2018, were five-year lease agreements for two additional injection molding machines and
one pallet mold, interest rate of 7.4% and maturity dates of February 23, 2023 and August 1, 2023, ( Agreements B ).
The lease agreements include a bargain purchase option to acquire the production equipment at the end of the lease terms. Lease
payments are made on a per invoice basis at rates of (i) $6.25 per pallet produced on the equipment leased pursuant to Agreement
A and sold to the private company estimated at $180,000 per month and (ii) $3.32 per pallet produced on the equipment leased pursuant
to Amendments B and sold to the private company estimated at $48,000 per month per machine. Both Agreements A   B provide
for minimum monthly lease rental payments based upon the total pallets sold in excess of a specified amount not to exceed the
monthly productive capacity of the leased machines.  

The
production equipment under the non-cancelable capital leases has a gross carrying amount of $9,924,907 at August 31, 2018. Amortization
of the carrying amount of approximately $402,000 and $246,000 was included in depreciation expense for the three months ended
August 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  

Future
minimum lease payments under non-cancelable capital leases as of August 31, 2018, are approximately:  

Note
8. Deferred Revenue  

Deferred
revenue as of August 31, 2018 and May 31, 2018 represent advance payments from a customer to purchase plastics pallets with shipments
expected to be complete by September 30, 2018. Greystone recognizes revenue as plastic pallets are shipped to the customer.
Recognized revenue totaled $3,280,500 during the three months ended August 31, 2018.  

Note
9. Revenue and Revenue Recognition  

On
June 1, 2018, Greystone adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ,
as amended, using the retrospective method. Greystone determined that there was no cumulative effect adjustment to the Consolidated
Financial Statements and the adoption of the new standard did not require  any adjustments
to Greystone s consolidated financial statements for prior periods . Under the guidance of the new standard, revenue
is recognized at the time a good or service is transferred to a customer and the customer obtains control of that good or receives
the service performed. Sales arrangements with customers are short-term in nature involving single performance obligations related
to the delivery of goods and generally provide for transfer of control at the time of shipment. In limited circumstances, where
acceptance of the goods is subject to approval by the customer, revenue is recognized upon approval by the customer unless, historically,
there have been insignificant rejections of goods by the customer. Contract liabilities associated with sales arrangements primarily
relate to deferred revenue on prepaid sales of goods. Greystone generally permits returns of product due to defects;
however, product returns are historically insignificant.  

The
                                         amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which Greystone expects to
                                         be entitled to receive in exchange for its products. The following steps are applied
                                         in determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition:  

1.    Identification
                                         of a contract with a customer is a sales arrangement involving a purchase order issued
                                         by the customer stating each party s rights regarding the plastic pallets to be
                                         transferred. Payment terms vary by customer from net 30 days to 90 days. Discounts on
                                         sales arrangements are generally not provided. Credit worthiness is determined by Greystone
                                         based on payment experience and financial information available on the customer.    

2.  
      Identification
    of performance obligations in the sales arrangement which is predominantly the promise to transfer plastic pallets to Greystone s
    customer.   

3.  
      Determination
    of the transaction price which is specified in the purchase order based on product pricing negotiated between Greystone and
    the customer.   

4.  
      Allocate
    the transaction price to performance obligations.   

5.  
      Recognition
    of revenue which predominantly occurs upon completion of the performance obligation and transfer of control. Transfer of
    control generally occurs at the point of shipment which is Greystone s manufacturing and warehouse locations.   

Greystone s
principal product is plastic pallets produced from recycled plastic resin. Sales are primarily to customers in the continental
United States of America. International sales are made to customers in Canada and Mexico which totaled approximately $170,000
and $305,000 in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.  

Greystone s
customers include stocking and non-stocking distributors and direct sales to end-user customers. Sales to Greystone s three
largest customers, which are end-users, totaled approximately 84% and 73% of sales in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Sales to distributors totaled approximately 14% and 23% of sales in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Combined sales to
Greystone s three largest customers and distributors totaled approximately 98% and 96% of sales in fiscal years 2019 and
2018, respectively. The third large customer was a new addition during the last quarter of fiscal year 2018 and had approximately
18% of sales in fiscal year 2019.   

Note
10. Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The
following methods and assumptions are used in estimating the fair-value disclosures for financial instruments:  

Debt:
The carrying amount of notes with floating rates of interest approximate fair value. Fixed rate notes are valued based on cash
flows using estimated rates of comparable notes. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet approximate fair value.  

Note
11. Concentrations, Risks and Uncertainties  

Greystone
derived approximately 84% and 73% of its total sales from three customers in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. The loss
of a material amount of business from one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on Greystone.  

Greystone
purchases damaged pallets from its customers at a price based on the value of the raw material content in the pallet. A majority
of these purchases, totaling $392,272 and $493,104 in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, is from one of its major customers.  

Robert
B. Rosene, Jr., a Greystone director, has provided financing and guarantees on Greystone s bank debt. As of August 31, 2018,
Greystone is indebted to Mr. Rosene in the amount of $4,467,330 for a note payable due January 15, 2020. There is no assurance
that Mr. Rosene will renew the note as of the maturity date.  

Note
12. Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) , which is intended to improve financial reporting about
leasing transactions. The ASU will require organizations ( lessees ) that lease assets with lease terms of more than
twelve months to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases.
In addition, the ASU will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount,
timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The effective date of this ASU is for fiscal years beginning after December
31, 2018 and interim periods within that year. Management has reviewed Greystone s leases and determined that the implementation
of ASU 2016-02 will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.  

Note
13. Commitments

amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the three months ended August 31, 2017 have been restated to conform
to classifications utilized in the three months ended August 31, 2018.  

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    

Results
of Operations    

General
to All Periods   

The
unaudited consolidated statements include Greystone Logistics, Inc., and its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Greystone Manufacturing,
L.L.C. ( GSM ) and Plastic Pallet Production, Inc. ( PPP ). Greystone also consolidates its variable interest
entity, Greystone Real Estate, L.L.C. ( GRE ). All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  

References
to fiscal year 2019 refer to the three month period ended August 31, 2018. References to fiscal year 2018 refer to the three
month period ended August 31, 2017.  

Sales   

Greystone s
primary focus is to provide quality plastic pallets to its existing customers while continuing its marketing efforts to broaden
its customer base. Greystone s existing customers are primarily located in the United States and engaged in the beverage,
pharmaceutical and other industries. Greystone has generated, and plans to continue to generate, interest in its pallets by attending
trade shows sponsored by industry segments that would benefit from Greystone s products. Greystone hopes to gain wider product
acceptance by marketing the concept that the widespread use of plastic pallets could greatly reduce the destruction of trees on
a worldwide basis. Greystone s marketing is conducted through contract distributors, its President and other employees.  

Personnel   

Greystone
had approximately 211 and 176 full-time employees as of August 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  

Three-Month
Period Ended August 31, 2018 Compared to Three-Month Period Ended August 31, 2017    

Sales    

Sales
for fiscal year 2019 were $18,206,110 compared to $10,287,075 in fiscal year 2018 for an increase of $7,919,035. The increase
in pallet sales in fiscal year 2019 over 2018 was primarily due to the addition of a new customer and sales growth to a pallet
leasing company.  

Sales
to Greystone s three largest customers accounted for approximately 84% and 73% of sales in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.
A new customer obtained in February, 2018 accounted for approximately 18% of sales in fiscal year 2019; however, relations
with this new customer have not been established sufficiently to determine its on-going demand for pallets. Pallet sales to Greystone s
larger customers are generally based on the customers  need which may vary by period. Greystone is not able to predict the
future needs of these major customers and will continue its efforts to grow sales through the addition of new customers developed
through Greystone s marketing efforts.  

Cost
of Sales    

Cost
of sales in fiscal year 2019 was $15,760,152, or 87% of sales, compared to $8,388,176, or 82% of sales, in fiscal year 2018. The
significant increase in sales volume that Greystone has experienced of the past two years has had a direct effect on production
costs resulting in the increase in the ratio of cost of sales to sales from fiscal year 2018 to 2019. Certain products are more
labor intensive which affects the relationship of cost of sales to sales.  

In
addition, Greystone s ability to process unrefined recycled plastic resin has been limited due to the fact that the need
for refined plastic resin for production of pallets has exceeded Greystone s current capacity. Machinery to provide additional
capacity is expected to be installed in or about September or October, 2018. Also, Greystone has ordered machinery to automate
certain of its production lines to reduce the cost and the working conditions for production labor.  

General,
Selling and Administrative Expenses    

General,
selling and administrative expenses were $939,091 in fiscal year 2019 compared to $831,403 in fiscal year 2018 for an increase
of $107,688 or 13%. The difference between fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018 is primarily attributable to timing of expenses
for the respective periods.  

Other
Income (Expenses)    

Other
income was $2,269 and $8,263 in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.  

Interest
expense was $412,628 in fiscal year 2019 compared to $324,677 in fiscal year 2018 for an increase of $87,951. The increase in
interest expense in fiscal year 2019 over 2018 is due principally to increases in the prime rate of interest, 5.00% at August
31, 2018 compared to 4.25% at August 31, 2017, and increases in amount of debt and capital leases.  

Provision
for Income Taxes    

The
provision for income taxes was $331,600 and $220,800 in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The provision for income taxes
does not include the income from the variable interest entity as the entity is not included in the income tax returns of Greystone
and the taxable income from this entity is passed-through to the respective owners.  

Based
upon a review of its income tax filing positions, Greystone believes that its positions would be sustained upon an audit by the
Internal Revenue Service and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in a material change to its financial position.
Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded.  

Net
Income    

Greystone
recorded net income of $764,908 in fiscal year 2019 compared to net income of $530,282 in fiscal year 20178 primarily for the
reasons discussed above.  

Net
Income Attributable to Common Stockholders    

The
net income attributable to common stockholders for fiscal year 2019 was $601,388, or $0.02 per share, compared to $374,708, or
$0.01 per share, in fiscal year 2018 primarily for the reasons discussed above.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

A
summary of cash flows for the three-month period ended August 31, 2018 is as follows:  

The
contractual obligations of Greystone for long-term debt and capital lease obligations are as follows:  

Greystone
had a working capital deficit of $(2,882,648) at August 31, 2018. To provide for the funding to meet Greystone s operating
activities and contractual obligations as of August 31, 2018, Greystone will have to continue to produce positive operating results
or explore various options including additional long-term debt and equity financing. However, there is no guarantee that Greystone
will continue to create positive operating results or be able to raise sufficient capital to meet these obligations.  

Effective
August 10, 2018 and as discussed further in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, Greystone and IBC entered into the
Sixth Amendment to the IBC Loan Agreement dated January 31, 2014 which provided for new funding in the form of an advancing loan
in the amount of $3,600,000 to purchase production equipment of which $1,700,000 had been advanced at August 31, 2018. Additionally,
during fiscal year 2019, production equipment valued at approximately $2.3 million was acquired through a leasing arrangement.  

Substantially
all of the financing that Greystone has received through the last few fiscal years resulted primarily from bank notes which are
guaranteed by certain officers and directors of Greystone and, formerly, from loans provided certain officers and directors of
Greystone. Greystone continues to be dependent upon its officers and directors to provide and/or secure additional financing and
there is no assurance that its officers and directors will continue to do so. As such, there is no assurance that funding will
be available for Greystone to continue operations.  

Greystone
has 50,000 outstanding shares of cumulative 2003 Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $5,000,000 and a preferred dividend
rate of the prime rate of interest plus 3.25%. Greystone does not anticipate that it will make cash dividend payments to any holders
of its common stock unless and until the financial position of Greystone improves through increased revenues, another financing
transaction or otherwise. Pursuant to the IBC Loan Agreement, as discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements,
Greystone may pay dividends on its preferred stock in an amount not to exceed $500,000 per year.  

Forward
                                         Looking Statements and Material Risks    

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes certain statements that may be deemed  forward-looking statements  within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
These forward-looking statements are made in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, that address activities, events or developments
that Greystone expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including decreased costs, securing financing,
the profitability of Greystone, potential sales of pallets or other possible business developments, are forward-looking statements.
Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements contained in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q could be affected by any of the following factors: Greystone s prospects could be affected
by changes in availability of raw materials, competition, rapid technological change and new legislation regarding environmental
matters; Greystone may not be able to secure additional financing necessary to sustain and grow its operations; and a material
portion of Greystone s business is and will be dependent upon a few large customers and there is no assurance that Greystone
will be able to retain such customers. These risks and other risks that could affect Greystone s business are more fully
described in Greystone s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018, which was filed on August 29, 2018. Actual results
may vary materially from the forward-looking statements. Greystone undertakes no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements
contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.    

As
of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Greystone carried out an evaluation under the supervision
of Greystone s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Greystone s
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on an evaluation
as of May 31, 2018, Warren F. Kruger, Greystone s Chief Executive Officer, and William W. Rahhal, Greystone s Chief
Financial Officer, identified no material weakness in Greystone s internal control over financial reporting. As a result,
Greystone s CEO and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of Greystone s disclosure controls
and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of August 31, 2018.  

During
the three months ended August 31, 2018, there were no changes in Greystone s internal controls over financial reporting
that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, Greystone s internal control over financial
reporting.
