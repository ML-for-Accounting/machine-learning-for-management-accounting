1.   
       Nature
    of Business    

REGI
U.S., Inc. ( we ,  our , the  Company ,  REGI ) has been engaged in the business
of developing and building improved axial vane-type rotary devices for civilian, commercial and government applications with the
marketing and intellectual rights in the U.S. Effective February 17, 2017 REGI purchased the worldwide marketing and intellectual
rights, other than in the U.S., from Reg Technologies, Inc. ( Reg Tech ), a British Columbia company. No revenue has
been derived to date from REGI s principal operations of research and development.  

REGI
formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Rad Max Technologies, Inc., on April 10, 2007 in the State of Washington.  

2.   
       Significant
    Accounting Policies     

Principles
of consolidation   

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of REGI have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and
notes thereto for the year ended April 30, 2018 filed on Form 10-K with the SEC. In the opinion of management, the accompanying
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary
to present fairly the financial position and the results of operations for the interim period presented herein. The results of
operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or for any future
period. Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained
in the audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2018 as reported in the Form 10-K, have been omitted.  

These
financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries RadMax Technologies, Inc., and Rand Energy
Group Inc. ( Rand ).  

All
significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.  

Investment
in associates   

Investments
in which the Company has the ability to exert significant influence but does not have control are accounted for using the equity
method whereby the original cost of the investment is adjusted annually for the Company s share of earnings, losses and
dividends during the current year.  

The
Company owns 26.1% of equity interest in Minewest Silver and Gold Inc. ( Minewest ), a British Columbia company. Minewest
owns a 70% interest subject to a 10% Net Profits Interest in mining property in British Columbia. As at the date of this report,
Minewest is inactive due to lack of funding. As a result, the assets were impaired and no transactions are recorded for Minewest
during the year ended April 30, 2018 and the three months ended July 31, 2018.  

Risks
and uncertainties   

The
Company operates in an emerging industry that is subject to market acceptance and technological change. The Company s operations
are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including financial, operational, technological and other risks associated
with operating an emerging business, including the potential risk of business failure.  

Cash
and cash equivalents   

Cash
and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  

Furniture
and equipment   

Property
and equipment are stated at cost, which includes the acquisition price and any direct costs to bring the asset into use at its
intended location, less accumulated depreciation.  

Depreciation
of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method to write off the cost, net of any estimated residual value,
over their estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: Office equipment 5 years and electronic equipment 2 years. Depreciation
of office equipment is included in general and administrative expenses; Depreciation of research equipment is included in research
and development expense.  

Financial
instruments   

Fair
Value   

The
carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, amounts due to related parties and accounts payable approximate their fair values
because of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments.  

ASC
Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments
held by the Company. ASC Topic 825,  Financial Instruments,  defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation
hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels
of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:  

-  
      Level
    1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.   

-  
      Level
    2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs
    that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
    instrument.   

-  
      Level
    3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.   

Interest
Rate Risk   

The
Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to the short-term maturity of its monetary assets and liabilities.  

Credit
Risk   

The
Company s financial asset that is exposed to credit risk consists primarily of cash. To manage the risk, cash is placed
with major financial institutions.  

Currency
Risk   

The
Company s functional currency is the US dollar and the reporting currency is the US dollar.  

Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet
date. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included
in the determination of income. Foreign currency transactions are primarily undertaken in US dollars. The Company has not, to
the date of these consolidated financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency
fluctuations.  

For
reporting purposes assets and liabilities with Canadian dollar as functional currency are translated into US dollar at the period
end rates of exchange, and the results of the operations are translated at average rates of exchange for the period. The resulting
translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders  equity.  

Income
taxes   

Deferred
income taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the consolidated financial statements
and those reported for income tax purposes in accordance with ASC 740,  Income Taxes , which requires the use of the
asset/liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases, and for tax losses and credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The Company provides for deferred taxes for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and
carry-forwards when realization is more likely than not.  

Basic
and diluted net loss per share   

Basic
EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during
the period using the treasury stock method and convertible debt using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average
stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options
or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.  

Stock-based
compensation   

The
Company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718 which establishes the accounting treatment for transactions
in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. Under the provisions of FASB ASC 718, share-based payment
compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite
service period (generally the vesting period). The Company accounts for share-based payments to non-employees in accordance with
FASB ASC 505-50.  

Use
of estimates   

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions
related to useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and deferred income tax asset valuation
allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors
that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities, and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. To the extent
there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.  

Research
and development costs   

Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred.  

Related
Parties   

In
accordance with ASC 850  Related Party Disclosure , a party is considered to be related to the Company if the party
directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the
Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal
owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal with if one party controls or can significantly
influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented
from fully pursuing its own separate interests.  

Recent
accounting pronouncements   

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements.  

Reclassifications   

Certain
reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial information to conform to the presentation used in the financial
statements for the three months ended July 31, 2018.  

3.   
       Going
    Concern    

The
Company incurred net losses of $434,942 for the three months ended July 31, 2018 and has a working capital deficit of $1,294,617
and an accumulated deficit of $24,498,341 at July 31, 2018. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty. As a result, the Company s consolidated financial statements as of July 31, 2018 have been
prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments
in the normal course of business.  

The
Company also receives interim support from related parties and plans to raise additional capital through debt and/or equity financings.
There is no assurance that any of these activities will be successful. There continues to be insufficient funds to provide enough
working capital to fund ongoing operations for the next twelve months.  

4.
       
       Property
    and Equipment    

Property
and equipment at July 31, 2018 and April 30, 2018 consists of the following:  

Depreciation
expense totaled $1,551 and $1,198 for the three months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  

5.   
       Secured
    Convertible Promissory Notes    

As
of July 31, 2018, REGI has outstanding senior secured convertible promissory notes (the  Convertible Notes ) of $195,344
(net of unamortized discount of $50,166) issued to related parties and $1,172,654 (net of unamortized discount of $422,781) issued
to non-related parties. As of April 30, 2018, REGI has outstanding Convertible Notes of $142,762 (net of unamortized discount
of $54,816) issued to related parties and $997,468 (net of unamortized discount of $523,658) issued to non-related parties.  

During
the three months ended July 31, 2018 the Company issued Convertible Notes for cash proceeds of $90,000, service debt provided
by related parties of $27,932, and service debt provided by non-related parties of $16,357. During the twelve months ended April
30, 2018 the Company issued Convertible Notes for cash proceeds of $1,212,849, settled accounts payable from previous years of
$17,436, service debt provided by related parties of $131,577, and service debt provided by non-related parties of $182,696 of
which $66,600 was finders  fee and legal fees for cash based Convertible Notes recorded as discount to the Convertible Notes.  

The
Convertible Notes are secured against all assets of the Company, repayable two years after the issuance, bearing simple interest
rate of 10% during the term of the notes and simple interest rate of 20% after the due date with the exception of one Convertible
Note of $150,000 (net of unamortized discount of $7,684) repayable nine months after issuance, bearing simple interest of 2% during
the term of the note and simple interest rate of 15% after the due date.  

As
of July 31, 2018, $17,436, $40,800, $1,622,710, $60,000 and $100,000 of the Convertible Notes are convertible at any time on or
after ninety days from the issuance date into the Company s common stocks at $0.174, $0.12, $0.10, $0.09 and $0.08 per share
respectively.  

The
Company analyzed the conversion option in the notes for derivative accounting treatment under ASC Topic 815,  Derivatives
and Hedging,  and determined that the instrument does not qualify for derivative accounting.  

The
Company determined that the conversion option was subject to a beneficial conversion feature and during the three months ended
July 31, 2018 the company recorded a total beneficial conversion feature of $5,850, and amortization of the beneficial conversion
feature of $111,377 as interest expense. During the year ended April 30, 2018 the company recorded a total beneficial conversion
feature of $1,027,441, and amortization of the beneficial conversion feature of $510,311 as interest expense.

During
the twelve months ended April 30, 2018 the Company issued 155,000 shares of its common stock for options exercised at $0.10 per
share for a total of $15,500. Among the 155,000 shares of common stock, 55,000 were issued to a related party.  

During

officers, employees and consultants of the Company with the total value recorded at $562,700 based on the market trading price
as of the issuance date.  

On
November 2, 2017 the Company issued 3,172,269 shares of its common stock to Rand Energy. No value was assigned to these shares,
as Rand Energy did not have any assets. These shares together with 827,721 shares of common stock initially owned by Rand Energy
and recorded as the Company s treasury shares, were transferred to the 49% shareholders of Rand Energy, as consideration
for purchase of all of the 49% interest in Rand Energy, resulting in the Company owning 100% equity interest in Rand Energy.  

b)  
      Common
    Stock Options and Warrants   

On
March 1, 2018, REGI granted an aggregate of 1,400,000 common stock options for services. These options vest upon grant, expire
on March 1, 2023 and are exercisable at the following prices:  

On
April 30, 2018, REGI granted an aggregate of 500,000 common stock options for services. These options vest upon grant, expire
on April 30, 2023 and are exercisable at the following prices:  

A
summary of REGI s stock option activities for the three months ended July 31, 2018 and year ended April 30 2018 are as follows:  

The
weighted average remaining contractual life of the options is 3.42 years at July 31, 2018, and 3.67 years at April 30, 2018.  

At
July 31 and April 30, 2018 there were no warrants outstanding.  

8.   
       Income
    Taxes    

The
Company is subject to the income tax laws of the United States and the States of Washington and Oregon, and uses the liability
method, where deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes.  

On
December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the  Tax Reform Act ) was signed into law by President Trump. The
Tax Reform Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax regime by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate
tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also repealing the deduction for domestic production activities, implementing
a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. U.S. GAAP requires
that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted. The Company does not anticipate that
the  Tax Reform Act  will have any substantial effect on the Company s financial position in the near future.  

Deferred
tax assets consist of the tax effect of NOL carry-forwards. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred
tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding its realizability.  

The
composition of REGI s deferred tax assets at July 31 and April 30, 2018:  

Management
has determined that the Company is subject to examination of income tax filings in the United States for the 2014 through 2016
tax years.  

9.   
       Subsequent
    Events    

Management
has evaluated subsequent events from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were available to be issued
and determined that no material subsequent events exist other that the following.  

Subsequent
to July 31, 2018, the Company issued Convertible Notes for service debt provided by related parties of $47,400. The Convertible
Notes are secured against all assets of the Company, repayable two years after the issuance, bearing simple interest rate of 10%
during the term of the notes and simple interest rate of 20% after the due date.  

Subsequent
to July 31, 2018, a total of 1,210,589 shares of the Company s common stock were issued for Convertible Promissory notes
at $0.10 per share.

Nature
of Business   

We
are an early stage company engaged in the business of developing and building improved axial vane-type rotary devices for civilian,
commercial and government applications. We own the worldwide intellectual and marketing rights to the RadMax  technology.
Our vision is to develop advanced devices that reduce carbon footprint, reduce device size, weight and parts count, and increase
fuel and manufacturing efficiencies. We intend to develop and market these devices in cooperation with industry and government
partners. We are focused on creating new, disruptive technologies that are more efficient, compact and cost-effective than those
currently available.  

On
July 27, 2016, we undertook our reorganization, naming our wholly owned subsidiary, RadMax Technologies, Inc. ( RadMax )
as the Company s DBA for marketing and technology image.  

Recent
Development   

Effective
February 17, 2017 we purchased all assets of Reg Technologies Inc. ( Reg Tech ), a British Columbia public company,
with the issuance of 51,757,119 shares of our common stock, increasing our ownership in the intellectual and marketing rights
to the RadMax  technology from US only to worldwide. Reg Tech then distributed all these shares to its shareholders of record
as dividends. This consolidation of ownership to the technology better enables our focused research and development efforts.  

The
asset purchase also resulted in our ownership of 49% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Rand Energy Group Inc. ( Rand
Energy ), a British Columbia Company and 26% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Minewest Silver and Gold Inc.
( Minewest ), also a British Columbia company.  

Rand
Energy previously owned and transferred its intellectual and marketing rights to the original RadMax technology to Reg Tech. Effective
November 2, 2017, we issued 3,172,269 shares of our common stock to Rand Energy. These shares together with the 827,721 shares
of our common stock initially owned by Rand Energy and recorded as the Company s treasury shares, were transferred to the
49% shareholders of Rand Energy, as consideration for purchasing all of their 49% interest in Rand Energy, resulting in the Company
owing 100% equity interest of Rand Energy. This agreement with the 49% shareholder of Rand Energy settles any and all potential
claims between the companies.  

Minewest
is engaged in the business of acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. Minewest owns a 70% interest subject to a 10%
Net Profits Interest in mining property in British Columbia. As at the date the asset purchase and the date of this report, Minewest
is inactive due to lack of funding.  

Going
Concern   

We
incurred net losses of $434,942 for the three months ended July 31, 2018 and had a working capital deficit of $1,294,617 and an
accumulated deficit of $24,498,341 at July 31, 2018. Further losses are expected until we enter into licensing agreements of our
technologies. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.  

We
may receive interim support from related parties and plan to raise additional capital through debt and/or equity financings. We
may also raise additional funds when our outstanding options are exercised. However, there is no assurance that any of these activities
will be realized.  

Due
to the uncertainty of our ability to generate sufficient revenues from our operating activities and/or to obtain the necessary
financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, in their
report on our financial statements for the year ended April 30, 2018, our registered independent auditors included additional
comments indicating concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note
disclosures describing the circumstances that led to this disclosure by our registered independent auditors. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Results
of Operations for Three Months Ended July 31, 2018 Compared to the Three Months Ended July 31, 2017   

We
had a net loss of $434,942 during the three months ended July 31, 2018, increased from net loss of $390,552 during the three months
ended July 31, 2017.  

We
incurred research and development expenses of $120,358 in the three months ended July 31, 2018, a decrease as compared to research
and development expenses of $149,841 in the three months ended July 31, 2017.  

During
the three months ended July 31, 2018 we incurred interest expense of $153,063 on secured convertible promissory notes as compared
to $54,250 on secured convertible promissory notes during the three months ended July 31, 2017.  

Total
other administrative expenses decreased from $186,461 in the three months ended July 31, 2017 to $161,521 in the three months
ended July 31, 2018.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

During
the three months ended July 31, 2018, we financed our operations mainly with proceeds of $90,000 from issuance of secured convertible
promissory notes.  

At
July 31, 2018 total amount owed to related parties is $139,018 as of July 31, 2018. This funding was necessary to meet our research
and development targets and place us in a position to attain profit. These balances owed to related parties are non-interest bearing,
unsecured and repayable on demand.  

We
plan to raise additional capital through debt and/or equity financings. We cannot provide any assurance that additional funding
will be available to finance our operations on acceptable terms in order to enable us to complete our plan of operations. There
are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any other form of additional financing.
If we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue our plan of operations, then we will not be able to continue the
development of our technologies and our business will fail.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to our stockholders.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

We
have identified certain accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results
of operations. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for the three
months ended July 31, 2018, attached hereto.  

Contractual
Obligations   

We
do not currently have any contractual obligations requiring any payment obligation from us.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934  and are not required to
provide the information under this item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

(a)
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   

Based
upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures performed by our management, with participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to inadequate
segregation of duties.  

As
used herein,   disclosure controls and procedures   mean controls and other procedures of our company that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules
and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

We
are taking steps to enhance and improve the design of our disclosure controls. During the period covered by this interim report,
we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we need to appoint
additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties, and adopt sufficient written policies and procedures
for accounting and financial reporting. These remediation efforts are largely dependent upon securing additional financing to
cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be
adversely affected.  

(b)
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended July 31, 2018 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
