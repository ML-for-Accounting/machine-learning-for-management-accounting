# Machine learning for management accounting
Here you can find the code for the examples provided in the research article *Machine learning in management accounting research: Literature review and pathways for the future*, available here https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09638180.2022.2137221

The folder *explainable AI* contains the example for Section 5.1. It also includes a dataset that can be used to experiment with the example. **However, the dataset is a randomized version of the original dataset used in the paper**. Thus, it cannot be used for research.

The folder text analysis contains examples for Sections 2.2, 2.4, and 3.3. The folder also contains a toy dataset of 100 10-X filings that can be used to experiment with the example codes. Due to size restrictions, the example code for Section 3.3 uses a simpler language model than used in the article. However, it includes guidelines/code on how to construct a similar language model using 10-K filings that was used in the paper.

**You can freely use the code, but kindly ask that if you do so, you cite the accompanying article. Thanks!**

If you need help implementing the code in your own research, you can contact the corresponding author of the accompanying article and the owner of this repository.
