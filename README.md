# Machine learning for management accounting
Here you can find the code for the examples provided in the research article *Machine learning in management accounting research: Literature review and pathways for the future*. The article is forthcoming in European Accounting Review, but the working paper version can be downloaded from https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3822650

The folder *explainable AI* contains the example for Section 5.1. It also includes a dataset that can be used to experiment with the example. **However, the dataset is a randomized version of the original dataset used in the paper**. Thus, it cannot be used for research.

The folder text analysis contains examples for Sections 2.2, 2.4, and 3.3. The folder also contains a toy dataset of 100 10-X filings that can be used to experiment with the example codes. Due to size restrictions, the example code for Section 3.3 uses a simpler language model than used in the article. However, it includes guidelines/code on how to construct a similar language model using 10-K filings that was used in the paper.

If you need help implementing the code in your own research, you can contact the corresponding author of the accompanying article and the owner of this repository.
